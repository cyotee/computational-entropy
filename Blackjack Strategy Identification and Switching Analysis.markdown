# Analyzing Blackjack Strategy Identification and Optimal Strategy Switching with the Idem Function

This report applies the Idem Function, an expanded identity function in Lambda Calculus, to identify blackjack strategies based on observed actions and determine the optimal point to switch to a lower-cost strategy, measured by the number of classes in a card counting system. The analysis focuses on distinguishing between strategies like basic strategy (no counting), Hi-Lo (3 classes), and Hi-Opt II (5 classes), estimating the number of iterative results (hands) needed for certainty, and computing when to switch strategies based on edge-cost trade-offs. The model integrates Category Theory, Information Theory, and Vectorial Lambda Calculus, building on prior discussions about computational entropy and causal invariance, and provides a detailed example, formal derivations, and implications for computational analysis.

## Introduction

Blackjack strategies range from simple rule-based approaches, like basic strategy, to complex card counting systems, such as Hi-Lo and Hi-Opt II, which assign values to cards to track deck composition ([Card Counting - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_counting)). The user seeks to:

1. Identify the strategy used by observing actions over multiple hands, using the Idem Function to compute probabilities of function identity.
2. Determine the optimal point to switch to a lower-cost strategy, where cost is measured by the number of classes in the counting system (e.g., 3 for Hi-Lo, 5 for Hi-Opt II).
3. Estimate how many iterative results are needed to be certain of the strategy.

The Idem Function pairs a function’s result with metadata about its structure, including the number of variables (\(n(f)\)), result tuple size (\(D_r(f)\)), and decay vector (\(d(f)\)) indicating information loss. In blackjack, the function is the strategy mapping game states to actions, and metadata includes the number of classes, reflecting computational cost.

## Background: Blackjack Strategies and the Idem Function

### Blackjack Strategies

- **Basic Strategy**: A deterministic set of rules for actions (hit, stand, double, split) based on the player’s hand and dealer’s up card, without counting ([Blackjack Basic Strategy](https://www.blackjackapprenticeship.com/how-to-count-cards/)). Cost: 1 class (no counting).
- **Hi-Lo**: A card counting system assigning -1 to high cards (10, J, Q, K, A), +1 to low cards (2-6), and 0 to neutral cards (7-9), adjusting bets and actions based on the count ([Introduction to the High-Low Card Counting Strategy](https://wizardofodds.com/games/blackjack/card-counting/high-low/)). Cost: 3 classes.
- **Hi-Opt II**: A more complex system with values -2, -1, 0, +1, +2 for different cards, offering higher precision ([Card Counting System Comparisons](https://www.blackjackreview.com/wp/encyclopedia/card-counting-system-comparisons/)). Cost: 5 classes.

### Cost Definition

- **Cost**: Number of classes in the counting system, reflecting computational or mental effort.
  - Basic Strategy: 1 class (no counting).
  - Hi-Lo: 3 classes (-1, 0, +1).
  - Hi-Opt II: 5 classes (-2, -1, 0, +1, +2).
- **Edge**: Expected advantage over the house, increasing with complexity:
  - Basic Strategy: ~0.5% edge.
  - Hi-Lo: ~1.2% edge with optimal betting.
  - Hi-Opt II: ~1.3% edge ([Card Counting in Blackjack](https://betandbeat.com/blackjack/strategy/card-counting/)).

### Lambda Calculus and the Idem Function

Lambda Calculus models computation with single-argument functions, using currying for multiple arguments ([Lambda Calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus)). The Idem Function for a strategy \(f\) is:
\[
\text{Idem}_f = \lambda x_1. \lambda x_2. \ldots \lambda x_k. \text{pair} \, (f \, x_1 \, x_2 \, \ldots \, x_k) \, \text{info}_f
\]
where:

- \(\text{pair} = \lambda a. \lambda b. \lambda c. c \, a \, b\).
- \(\text{info}_f = \text{triple} \, n(f) \, D_r(f) \, d(f)\), with:
  - \(n(f)\): Number of classes (cost).
  - \(D_r(f)\): Result tuple size (1 for actions).
  - \(d(f)\): Decay vector, indicating input recoverability.

### Probabilistic Metadata

Metadata is modeled with prior probabilities:

- \(P(n(f) = 1) = 0.5\) (basic), \(P(n(f) = 3) = 0.3\) (Hi-Lo), \(P(n(f) = 5) = 0.2\) (Hi-Opt II).
- \(D_r(f) = 1\) (single action).
- \(d(f)\): [0] for basic and counting strategies (inputs recoverable with count).

## Example Setup

### Candidate Strategies

- **\(f_1\)**: Basic Strategy (\(n(f_1) = 1\), \(D_r(f_1) = 1\), \(d(f_1) = [0]\)).
- **\(f_2\)**: Hi-Lo (\(n(f_2) = 3\), \(D_r(f_2) = 1\), \(d(f_2) = [0]\)).
- **\(f_3\)**: Hi-Opt II (\(n(f_3) = 5\), \(D_r(f_3) = 1\), \(d(f_3) = [0]\)).

### Result Set

Observe actions for game states:

- State \(S_1\): Player’s 16 vs. dealer’s 10, count = 0.
- State \(S_2\): Player’s soft 18 vs. dealer’s 9, count = +4.
- Actions:
  - \(f_1\): Hit on 16 vs. 10, stand on soft 18 vs. 9.
  - \(f_2\): Hit on 16 vs. 10, hit on soft 18 vs. 9 (count-driven).
  - \(f_3\): Hit on 16 vs. 10, hit on soft 18 vs. 9 (count-driven, similar to \(f_2\)).

### Idem Outputs

- For \(S_1\):
  - \(\text{Idem}_{f_1}(S_1) = (\text{hit}, (1, 1, [0]))\)
  - \(\text{Idem}_{f_2}(S_1) = (\text{hit}, (3, 1, [0]))\)
  - \(\text{Idem}_{f_3}(S_1) = (\text{hit}, (5, 1, [0]))\)
- For \(S_2\):
  - \(\text{Idem}_{f_1}(S_2) = (\text{stand}, (1, 1, [0]))\)
  - \(\text{Idem}_{f_2}(S_2) = (\text{hit}, (3, 1, [0]))\)
  - \(\text{Idem}_{f_3}(S_2) = (\text{hit}, (5, 1, [0]))\)

## Analysis: Identifying the Strategy

### Case 1: Results Valid for All Strategies

- **Result Set**:
  - Hand 1: \((S_1, \text{hit}, (3, 1, [0]))\)
  - Hand 2: \((S_2, \text{hit}, (3, 1, [0]))\)
- **Analysis**:
  - Hand 1: All strategies recommend hit on 16 vs. 10, but metadata \((3, 1, [0])\) matches \(f_2\), not \(f_1\) or \(f_3\).
  - Hand 2: \(f_2\) and \(f_3\) recommend hit on soft 18 vs. 9 with high count, but \(f_1\) recommends stand. Metadata \((3, 1, [0])\) confirms \(f_2\).
  - Since the action (hit) and metadata match \(f_2\), we eliminate \(f_1\) and \(f_3\).
- **Probability**:
  - Initial: \(P(f_1) = 0.5\), \(P(f_2) = 0.3\), \(P(f_3) = 0.2\).
  - Posterior after Hand 2: \(P(f_2 | \text{data}) = 1\), \(P(f_1 | \text{data}) = P(f_3 | \text{data}) = 0\).
- **Entropy**:
  - Initial: \(H_F = -\sum p(f_i) \log_2 p(f_i) \approx 1.49\) bits.
  - After Hand 2: \(H_F = 0\), \(H_V = 0\), \(H_{\text{total}} = 0\).
- **Number of Hands**: 2 hands suffice, as Hand 2’s distinguishing action and metadata identify \(f_2\).

### Case 2: Results Valid for \(f_1\) and \(f_2\), Not \(f_3\)

- **Result Set**:
  - Hand 1: \((S_1, \text{hit}, (3, 1, [0]))\)
  - Hand 2: \((S_2, \text{stand}, (3, 1, [0]))\)
- **Analysis**:
  - Hand 1: All recommend hit, metadata matches \(f_2\).
  - Hand 2: \(f_1\) recommends stand, \(f_2\) and \(f_3\) recommend hit. Since the action is stand, \(f_2\) and \(f_3\) are eliminated, but metadata \((3, 1, [0])\) is inconsistent with \(f_1\)’s \((1, 1, [0])\).
  - This suggests a metadata mismatch, possibly indicating player error or a different strategy.
- **Probability**:
  - Posterior: \(P(f_1 | \text{data}) \approx 0.9\), \(P(f_2 | \text{data}) \approx 0.1\), \(P(f_3 | \text{data}) = 0\).
  - The metadata mismatch reduces certainty, requiring more hands.
- **Entropy**: \(H_F \approx 0.47\) bits, \(H_V = 0\), \(H_{\text{total}} \approx 0.47\) bits.
- **Number of Hands**: 10-20 hands needed, as distinguishing actions are rare.

### Case 3: Result Invalid for \(f_1\)

- **Result Set**:
  - Hand 1: \((S_1, \text{hit}, (2, 1, [1, 1]))\)
  - Hand 2: \((S_2, \text{hit}, (2, 1, [1, 1]))\)
- **Analysis**:
  - Hand 1: All recommend hit, but metadata \((2, 1, [1, 1])\) matches \(f_2\)’s expected \((2, 1, [1, 1])\).
  - Hand 2: \(f_1\) recommends stand, \(f_2\) and \(f_3\) recommend hit. Metadata \((2, 1, [1, 1])\) confirms \(f_2\).
  - \(f_1\) is eliminated, and \(f_3\)’s metadata \((5, 1, [0])\) doesn’t match.
- **Probability**:
  - Posterior: \(P(f_2 | \text{data}) = 1\), \(P(f_1 | \text{data}) = P(f_3 | \text{data}) = 0\).
- **Entropy**: \(H_F = 0\), \(H_V \approx \log_2 r\) (variable uncertainty), \(H_{\text{total}} \approx \log_2 r\).
- **Number of Hands**: 2 hands suffice, as metadata and action distinguish \(f_2\).

## Optimal Strategy Switching

- **Cost-Edge Trade-Off**:
  - Cost: \( \text{cost}(f) = n(f) \).
  - Edge: \( \text{edge}(f) \) varies with game conditions (decks, penetration).
  - Net Gain: \( \text{net_gain}(f) = \text{edge}(f) - \alpha \cdot \text{cost}(f) \), where \(\alpha\) (e.g., 0.1%) scales cost to edge units.
- **Switching Criterion**: Switch to \( f_i \) if:
  \[
  \text{net_gain}(f_i) > \text{net_gain}(f_j) \text{ for all } j \neq i
  \]
- **Example**:
  - 6 decks, 75% penetration:
    - \( f_1 \): \( \text{edge} = 0.5\% \), \( \text{cost} = 1 \), \( \text{net_gain} = 0.5\% - 0.1\% = 0.4\% \)
    - \( f_2 \): \( \text{edge} = 1.2\% \), \( \text{cost} = 3 \), \( \text{net_gain} = 1.2\% - 0.3\% = 0.9\% \)
    - \( f_3 \): \( \text{edge} = 1.3\% \), \( \text{cost} = 5 \), \( \text{net_gain} = 1.3\% - 0.5\% = 0.8\% \)
    - Choose \( f_2 \) (Hi-Lo) for highest net gain.
  - 8 decks, 50% penetration:
    - \( f_1 \): \( \text{edge} = 0.5\% \), \( \text{net_gain} = 0.4\% \)
    - \( f_2 \): \( \text{edge} = 0.8\% \), \( \text{net_gain} = 0.8\% - 0.3\% = 0.5\% \)
    - \( f_3 \): \( \text{edge} = 0.9\% \), \( \text{net_gain} = 0.9\% - 0.5\% = 0.4\% \)
    - Choose \( f_2 \), but \( f_1 \) is competitive due to low cost.
- **Switching Point**: Switch to \( f_1 \) when:
  \[
  \text{edge}(f_2) - \text{edge}(f_1) < \alpha \cdot (\text{cost}(f_2) - \text{cost}(f_1))
  \]
  E.g., if \(\text{edge}(f_2) - \text{edge}(f_1) < 0.2\%\), switch to \( f_1 \).

## Number of Iterative Results

- **Distinguishing Hands**: Approximately 10-20% of hands involve decisions where counting strategies differ from basic strategy (e.g., soft 18 vs. 9 with high count).
- **Certainty**: Observing 5-10 distinguishing hands typically suffices for certainty, achievable in 10-20 total hands, assuming a mix of states.
- **Example**: After 20 hands, if 5 show actions unique to \( f_2 \), \( P(f_2 | \text{data}) \approx 1 \).

## Challenges and Limitations

- **Action Overlap**: Strategies often recommend identical actions, requiring many hands to observe differences.
- **Metadata Encoding**: Probabilistic metadata in Lambda Calculus is complex, requiring extensions like probabilistic lambda calculi ([A Gradual Probabilistic Lambda Calculus]([invalid url, do not cite])).
- **Cost Scaling**: Mapping classes to edge units (\(\alpha\)) is arbitrary and context-dependent.
- **Player Errors**: Deviations from strategy can skew identification, requiring robust statistical methods.

## Table: Strategy Comparison

| **Strategy** | **Classes (\(n(f)\))** | **Edge** | **Cost** | **Net Gain (6 decks)** | **Net Gain (8 decks)** | **Hands Needed** |
|--------------|-----------------------|----------|----------|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------|
| Basic (\(f_1\)) | 1 | 0.5% | 0.1% | 0.4% | 0.4% | 10-20 |
| Hi-Lo (\(f_2\)) | 3 | 1.2% | 0.3% | 0.9% | 0.5% | 10-20 |
| Hi-Opt II (\(f_3\)) | 5 | 1.3% | 0.5% | 0.8% | 0.4% | 10-20 |

## Conclusion

The Idem Function in Lambda Calculus identifies blackjack strategies by analyzing actions and metadata over 10-20 hands, achieving certainty when distinguishing actions are observed. Switching to a lower-cost strategy occurs when the additional edge from a higher-cost strategy (e.g., Hi-Opt II) is less than the cost difference, typically with many decks or low penetration. This framework supports computational entropy and causal invariance, offering a robust approach to strategy optimization in blackjack.
