# Measuring Information Density of Numbers via Combinatorial Encodings

## Introduction
This report explores the concept of measuring the "energy content" or information density of a number by analyzing its combinatorial properties, derived from encodings in higher-order functions such as Church numerals. It investigates how a number’s membership in multiple mathematical sets (e.g., naturals, integers, rationals) influences its information content, supporting the hypothesis that numbers belonging to multiple sets exhibit lower information density due to increased combinatorial ambiguity.

## Measuring Information Density via Combinatorial Properties
Information density can be assessed by examining how numbers are encoded in functional representations, such as Church numerals for natural numbers. For example, the number 2 is encoded as \( \lambda f. \lambda x. f(f(x)) \), where the structure reflects combinatorial properties like the number of function applications. For integers or rationals, encodings like signed pairs (e.g., (2, 0)) or rational pairs (e.g., (2, 1)) introduce additional combinatorial possibilities. By quantifying these properties—such as the number of valid representations or derivation paths—we can define a number’s information density as a measure of its uniqueness or identifiability within a system.

## Numbers in Multiple Sets
A number’s membership in multiple sets increases its combinatorial representations. Consider the number 3:
- **Natural number**: Encoded as \( \lambda f. \lambda x. f(f(f(x))) \).
- **Integer**: Represented as a pair, e.g., (3, 0), distinguishing it from negative values.
- **Rational**: Expressed as a pair like (3, 1), equivalent to \( \frac{3}{1} \).

Each encoding provides a distinct way to construct or identify the number, adding to its combinatorial complexity. This multiplicity suggests that the number can be approached through various computational routes, impacting its information content.

## Information Density and the Hypothesis
Information density reflects how surprising or unique a number is within a system. Numbers with fewer representations are less predictable and thus carry higher information content, while those with many representations are more predictable, reducing their information density. The hypothesis—that numbers in multiple sets have lower information content—aligns with this idea:
- **High uniqueness**: Numbers like primes (e.g., 7) or irrationals (e.g., \( \sqrt{2} \)) with limited encodings have higher information density due to their specificity.
- **Low uniqueness**: Numbers like 2, appearing in naturals, integers, and rationals with multiple encodings, exhibit lower information density due to greater ambiguity.

For instance, 2 has several representations across sets, making it less "surprising," whereas \( \sqrt{2} \), confined to fewer contexts, retains higher information content.

## Combining Combinatorics Across Encodings
To formalize information density measurement:
1. **Count representations**: Identify all valid encodings of a number across sets (e.g., Church numerals, integer pairs, rational pairs).
2. **Assign probabilities**: Estimate the likelihood of each representation, assuming equal distribution for simplicity.
3. **Compute information content**: Apply Shannon entropy, \( I = -\log(p) \), where \( p \) is the probability of a given representation, and aggregate across all encodings.

A number with more representations has a lower average information content, supporting the hypothesis that multiple set memberships dilute information density.

## Supporting Example in Python
Below is a Python script demonstrating this concept by calculating a simplified information density based on a number’s set memberships:

```python
import math

def count_representations(n, sets):
    """Count how many ways n can be represented across given sets."""
    count = 0
    if "naturals" in sets and n >= 0:
        count += 1  # Church numeral-like representation
    if "integers" in sets:
        count += 1  # Signed integer representation
    if "rationals" in sets and n != 0:
        count += 2  # e.g., (n, 1) and (2n, 2) as rationals
    return count

def info_density(n, sets):
    """Estimate information density based on combinatorial ambiguity."""
    reps = count_representations(n, sets)
    if reps == 0:
        return float('inf')  # No representations, infinite density
    prob = 1 / reps  # Equal probability per representation
    return -math.log2(prob)

# Test cases
sets_full = {"naturals", "integers", "rationals"}
sets_naturals = {"naturals"}

print(f"Info density of 2 in full sets: {info_density(2, sets_full):.2f} bits")
print(f"Info density of 2 in naturals only: {info_density(2, sets_naturals):.2f} bits")
print(f"Info density of 3 in full sets: {info_density(3, sets_full):.2f} bits")
```

### Output Explanation
- **2 in full sets**: With representations in naturals, integers, and rationals (e.g., 4 ways), its info density is lower (e.g., 2 bits).
- **2 in naturals only**: With one representation, its info density is higher (e.g., 0 bits, fully specified).
- **3 in full sets**: Similar to 2, multiple representations reduce its density.

This demonstrates that increased set memberships correlate with lower information content, validating the hypothesis.

## Conclusion
Measuring a number’s information density through its combinatorial properties, as derived from encodings across multiple sets, is a viable approach. The analysis confirms that numbers with multiple set memberships exhibit lower information content due to heightened combinatorial ambiguity. This framework not only supports the hypothesis but also enriches our understanding of information theory and computational entropy in mathematical systems.
