Constant Entropy: A Unified Perspective on Thermodynamic and Computational Systems
Abstract
Entropy, a measure of disorder in thermodynamics and uncertainty in information theory, is pivotal across physical and computational domains. The Constant Entropy model proposes that total entropy, encompassing system entropy and an abstract "future potential" entropy, remains constant over time. This framework re-contextualizes entropy changes as translations from future possibilities to past actualities, unifying thermodynamic processes like gas expansion with computational systems like zero-knowledge proofs. Aimed at readers with thermodynamics and information theory backgrounds, this paper provides a rigorous explanation, reintegrating detailed calculations, formulas, and tables from prior versions, formatted in portable LaTeX for Markdown rendering with KaTeX, ensuring a comprehensive presentation without redundancy.
1. Introduction
Entropy bridges thermodynamics and information theory, quantifying disorder in physical systems and unpredictability in informational systems. In thermodynamics, entropy measures the unavailability of energy for work, governed by the second law, which states that the total entropy of a closed system and its surroundings never decreases (Second law of thermodynamics). In information theory, Shannon entropy measures the information required to resolve uncertainty (Entropy (information theory)). The Constant Entropy model posits that total entropy, including a notional "future potential" entropy, is conserved, with system entropy increases offset by decreases in potential entropy, representing the system’s capacity for order or work.
This model does not redefine entropy but reinterprets calculations, suggesting entropy shifts from future possibilities to past actualities, akin to a waveform collapse in quantum mechanics. It unifies physical systems, where entropy increases in irreversible processes, with computational systems, where information redistribution maintains constant entropy, as in reversible computing (Reversible computing) or zero-knowledge proofs (Zero-knowledge proof). This paper integrates all relevant research from prior document versions (V0, V1, V2, V3), including detailed calculations, formulas, and tables, formatted in LaTeX for portable Markdown rendering using KaTeX-compatible syntax, ensuring compatibility with VS Code’s Markdown preview (e.g., via Markdown+Math extension).
2. The Constant Entropy Model
2.1 Definition and Core Principles
The Constant Entropy model asserts that the total entropy of a system is conserved:
$$ H_{\text{total}} = H_{\text{system}} + H_{\text{potential}} $$
with changes satisfying:
$$ \Delta H_{\text{system}} = -\Delta H_{\text{potential}} $$

System Entropy ($H_{\text{system}}$): Measurable entropy, reflecting physical disorder or informational uncertainty.
Future Potential Entropy ($H_{\text{potential}}$): An abstract measure of latent capacity for order, work, or information, decreasing as system entropy increases.
Entropy Shift: Changes are translations from future possibilities to past actualities, maintaining constant total entropy.

This contrasts with standard thermodynamics, where system entropy often increases irreversibly, and aligns with computational systems where entropy is conserved, as per Landauer’s principle (Landauer’s principle).
2.2 Relation to Standard Models

Thermodynamics: Entropy changes are calculated using state variables (e.g., temperature, volume), with irreversible processes increasing system entropy. The model reinterprets these as shifts within a conserved total.
Information Theory: Shannon entropy assumes known computations, with entropy managed through data. The model emphasizes conservation, particularly in reversible or cryptographic systems.

3. Thermodynamic Applications
3.1 Closed Systems and Entropy
A closed system exchanges energy but not matter with its surroundings (Closed system). The available energy, or exergy, is the maximum work possible before equilibrium (Exergy):
$$ E_x = (U - U_0) + P_0 (V - V_0) - T_0 (S - S_0) $$
where $U$, $V$, $S$ are the system’s internal energy, volume, and entropy, and $U_0$, $V_0$, $S_0$ are equilibrium values at environmental temperature $T_0$ and pressure $P_0$. The energy balance is:
$$ \Delta U = Q - W $$
Entropy generation occurs in irreversible processes, with maximum system entropy when exergy is dissipated as heat, as in free expansion, where:
$$ S_{\text{gen}} = \frac{E_d}{T_0} $$
and $E_d$ is the exergy destroyed.
3.2 Example: Ideal Gas Expansion
Consider 1 mole of a monatomic ideal gas with molar heat capacity at constant volume $C_v = \frac{3}{2} R$, where $R = 8.314 , \text{J}/(\text{mol} \cdot \text{K})$, expanding from 1 m³ to 2 m³ at 300 K in an isolated system (no heat or work exchange with surroundings). We analyze reversible adiabatic expansion, irreversible adiabatic expansion, and free expansion to illustrate entropy changes and their interpretation under the Constant Entropy model.
Reversible Adiabatic Expansion

Work Done:

The final temperature $T_2$ is determined by the adiabatic condition:
$$ T_2 = T_1 \left( \frac{V_1}{V_2} \right)^{\gamma - 1} $$
where $\gamma = \frac{C_p}{C_v} = \frac{5/3}{3/2} = \frac{5}{3}$. For $T_1 = 300 , \text{K}$, $V_1 = 1 , \text{m}^3$, $V_2 = 2 , \text{m}^3$:
$$ T_2 = 300 \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{2/3} \approx 189 , \text{K} $$
The work done is:
$$ W_{\text{rev}} = n C_v (T_1 - T_2) = 1 \times \frac{3}{2} \times 8.314 \times (300 - 189) \approx 1385 , \text{J} $$

Entropy Change: Since the process is reversible and adiabatic ($Q = 0$):

$$ \Delta S_{\text{system}} = 0 $$

Constant Entropy Interpretation: No entropy is generated, preserving future potential entropy. The total entropy ($H_{\text{total}} = H_{\text{system}} + H_{\text{potential}}$) remains constant, as no disorder is added, and the system retains its full capacity for work or order.

Irreversible Adiabatic Expansion

Work Done: The gas expands against a constant external pressure $P_{\text{ext}} = 0.5 P_1$, where the initial pressure is:

$$ P_1 = \frac{n R T_1}{V_1} = \frac{1 \times 8.314 \times 300}{1} = 2494.2 , \text{Pa} $$
$$ P_{\text{ext}} = 0.5 \times 2494.2 = 1247.1 , \text{Pa} $$
The work done is:
$$ W = P_{\text{ext}} (V_2 - V_1) = 1247.1 \times (2 - 1) = 1247.1 , \text{J} $$

Temperature Change: Since $Q = 0$, the internal energy change is:

$$ \Delta U = -W = n C_v (T_2 - T_1) $$
$$ 1 \times \frac{3}{2} \times 8.314 \times (T_2 - 300) = -1247.1 $$
$$ T_2 \approx 300 - \frac{1247.1}{\frac{3}{2} \times 8.314} \approx 200.04 , \text{K} $$

Entropy Change: The entropy change for an ideal gas is:

$$ \Delta S_{\text{system}} = n C_v \ln \left( \frac{T_2}{T_1} \right) + n R \ln \left( \frac{V_2}{V_1} \right) $$
$$ \approx 1 \times \frac{3}{2} \times 8.314 \times \ln \left( \frac{200.04}{300} \right) + 1 \times 8.314 \times \ln 2 $$
$$ \approx 1 \times \frac{3}{2} \times 8.314 \times (-0.4055) + 1 \times 8.314 \times 0.6931 $$
$$ \approx -5.05 + 5.76 = 0.71 , \text{J}/\text{K} $$

Constant Entropy Interpretation: The system’s entropy increases by 0.71 J/K due to irreversibility, reflecting inefficiency. In the Constant Entropy model, this increase is balanced by a 0.71 J/K decrease in future potential entropy, representing the lost capacity for work due to inefficiency, maintaining constant total entropy.

Free Expansion

Work Done: The gas expands into a vacuum, so no work is done ($W = 0$) and no heat is transferred ($Q = 0$).
Temperature: Since $\Delta U = 0$ for an ideal gas with no work or heat exchange:

$$ T_2 = T_1 = 300 , \text{K} $$

Entropy Change:

$$ \Delta S_{\text{system}} = n R \ln \left( \frac{V_2}{V_1} \right) $$
$$ = 1 \times 8.314 \times \ln 2 \approx 5.76 , \text{J}/\text{K} $$

Constant Entropy Interpretation: This represents the maximum system entropy change for the volume doubling, as all exergy is dissipated internally, maximizing disorder. In the model, the future potential entropy decreases by 5.76 J/K, exhausting the system’s capacity for order, akin to heat death where molecules are indistinguishable across the volume, losing identity as a specific gas volume (Point 4, 32). The total entropy remains constant.

3.3 Example: Methane Combustion
Consider methane combustion in a closed system with a piston:
$$ \text{CH}_4 + 2 \text{O}_2 \to \text{CO}_2 + 2 \text{H}_2\text{O} $$
The reaction releases chemical energy, some of which can be converted to work via expansion, with entropy changes depending on process efficiency.
Reversible Combustion Process

Available Energy: The maximum work is the negative Gibbs free energy change at 298 K, 1 atm, calculated as:

$$ \Delta H^\circ = -890.3 , \text{kJ}/\text{mol}, \quad \Delta S^\circ = -242.8 , \text{J}/(\text{mol} \cdot \text{K}) $$
$$ \Delta G^\circ = \Delta H^\circ - T \Delta S^\circ $$
$$ = -890.3 \times 10^3 - 298 \times (-242.8) $$
$$ \approx -890.3 \times 10^3 + 72354.4 \approx -817945.6 , \text{J}/\text{mol} \approx -818.0 , \text{kJ}/\text{mol} $$
$$ W_{\text{max}} = -\Delta G^\circ = 818.0 , \text{kJ}/\text{mol} $$

Entropy Change: The system’s entropy decreases due to the formation of more ordered products (fewer moles of gas):

$$ \Delta S_{\text{system}} = \Delta S^\circ = -242.8 , \text{J}/(\text{mol} \cdot \text{K}) $$
The surroundings’ entropy increases due to heat release at $T_0 = 298 , \text{K}$:
$$ \Delta S_{\text{surr}} = \frac{-\Delta H^\circ}{T_0} = \frac{890.3 \times 10^3}{298} \approx 2987.6 , \text{J}/(\text{mol} \cdot \text{K}) $$
The total entropy change for the universe is:
$$ \Delta S_{\text{total}} = \Delta S_{\text{system}} + \Delta S_{\text{surr}} = -242.8 + 2987.6 \approx 2744.8 , \text{J}/(\text{mol} \cdot \text{K}) $$

Constant Entropy Interpretation: The system’s entropy decreases by 242.8 J/(mol·K), suggesting increased order due to the reaction’s stoichiometry. In the Constant Entropy model, this decrease is offset by a 242.8 J/(mol·K) increase in future potential entropy, preserving potential for future processes (e.g., further reactions or work), maintaining constant total entropy. The significant increase in surroundings’ entropy reflects the transfer of disorder to the environment, consistent with the second law, but the model focuses on the system’s internal entropy balance.

Irreversible Combustion (All Energy as Heat)

Setup: Assume no work is done ($W = 0$), and all energy is released as heat, aligning with the user’s clarification of focusing on heat release rather than work:

$$ Q = \Delta H^\circ = -890.3 , \text{kJ}/\text{mol} $$

Entropy Change: The system entropy remains unchanged from the reversible case, as it depends on the reaction’s thermodynamics:

$$ \Delta S_{\text{system}} = -242.8 , \text{J}/(\text{mol} \cdot \text{K}) $$
The surroundings’ entropy increases due to the heat absorbed:
$$ \Delta S_{\text{surr}} = \frac{-Q}{T_0} = \frac{890.3 \times 10^3}{298} \approx 2987.6 , \text{J}/(\text{mol} \cdot \text{K}) $$
The total entropy change is:
$$ \Delta S_{\text{total}} = -242.8 + 2987.6 \approx 2744.8 , \text{J}/(\text{mol} \cdot \text{K}) $$

Constant Entropy Interpretation: The fixed system entropy ($-242.8 , \text{J}/(\text{mol} \cdot \text{K})$) across both reversible and irreversible processes suggests a state-dependent transformation driven by the reaction’s stoichiometry. In the Constant Entropy model, the system’s entropy decrease is balanced by a 242.8 J/(mol·K) increase in future potential entropy, maintaining constant total entropy. The high $\Delta S_{\text{total}}$ reflects inefficiency, as no work is extracted, maximizing disorder transfer to the surroundings, but the model emphasizes the system’s internal entropy balance. This aligns with the user’s view of heat release maximizing disorder, akin to thermodynamic processes approaching heat death.

Maximum Entropy Consideration
Unlike gas expansion, where free expansion maximizes system entropy (e.g., 5.76 J/K), maximizing $\Delta S_{\text{system}}$ for methane combustion is complex because $\Delta S_{\text{system}} = -242.8 , \text{J}/(\text{mol} \cdot \text{K})$ is fixed by the reaction’s thermodynamics unless the final state changes (e.g., an unreacted mixture of reactants, which would deviate from combustion). To achieve a positive or maximized $\Delta S_{\text{system}}$, a disordered state would be required, but this is not the natural outcome of combustion, which produces more ordered products. The Constant Entropy model interprets the fixed $\Delta S_{\text{system}}$ as a shift in potential entropy, with the surroundings’ entropy ($2987.6 , \text{J}/(\text{mol} \cdot \text{K})$) dominating total disorder, contributing to universal indistinguishability similar to heat death (Heat death of the universe). The model’s focus on system entropy conservation highlights the balance between actual and potential entropy, even when the universe’s entropy increases significantly.
4. Information-Theoretic Applications
4.1 Shannon Entropy
Shannon entropy quantifies the uncertainty in a message or system, representing the average information required to predict an outcome:
$$ H = -\sum_{i} p_i \log_2 p_i $$
where $p_i$ is the probability of outcome $i$. A high-entropy system, such as a random sequence of bits, requires more information to predict, while a low-entropy system, like a repetitive sequence, is predictable (Entropy (information theory)).
4.2 Example: Zero-Knowledge Proof
In a zero-knowledge proof, a prover demonstrates the validity of a statement, such as a digital signature, without revealing the secret key, which typically has high entropy (e.g., 256 bits, corresponding to $H_{Cs} = 256$ bits for a uniform distribution over $2^{256}$ possible keys).

Process: The verification process confirms the statement’s validity, reducing the entropy associated with the proof to zero ($H_{Cv} \to 0$), as the outcome (valid or invalid) becomes certain. The secret key’s entropy remains constant ($H_{Cs} = 256$ bits), as no information about the key is revealed.
Constant Entropy Interpretation: The total entropy of the system is conserved. The decrease in verifiable entropy ($H_{Cv}$) due to the certainty of the proof is balanced by the persistent high entropy of the secret key ($H_{Cs}$), translating future potential (the uncertainty of the key) to past actuality (the certainty of the proof). This mirrors the thermodynamic free expansion example, where the system’s entropy maximizes at the cost of potential order, maintaining constant total entropy. The model’s application to zero-knowledge proofs highlights its utility in cryptographic systems, where security relies on maintaining high entropy in hidden information (Zero-knowledge proof).

4.3 Example: Reversible Computing
In reversible computing, operations such as the Toffoli gate preserve information, avoiding entropy increases by ensuring that inputs can be recovered from outputs (Reversible computing). This aligns with the principles of Landauer’s principle, which states that irreversible operations increase entropy by erasing information (Landauer’s principle).

Process: A Toffoli gate performs a reversible logical operation, such as a controlled-controlled-NOT, with no loss of information. For a three-bit input, the output uniquely determines the input, maintaining the same number of possible states.
Entropy Change: The entropy before and after computation is constant:

$$ H_{\text{input}} = H_{\text{output}} $$
For a uniform distribution over $2^3 = 8$ possible three-bit inputs:
$$ H = -\sum_{i=1}^{8} \frac{1}{8} \log_2 \frac{1}{8} = 3 , \text{bits} $$
This entropy remains unchanged post-computation.

Constant Entropy Interpretation: No entropy shift occurs, as the system preserves its information content, maintaining future potential entropy. This is analogous to the reversible adiabatic expansion in thermodynamics, where no entropy is generated, and the system retains its capacity for work or order. The Constant Entropy model interprets this as a system maintaining its full potential for information processing, with no translation to disorder, reinforcing the model’s applicability across domains.

4.4 Additional Example: Data Compression
Data compression, such as Huffman coding, reduces the size of a message while preserving its information content, aiming to approach the source’s Shannon entropy (Data compression). The entropy of the source message determines the theoretical minimum size:
$$ H = -\sum_{i} p_i \log_2 p_i $$

Process: Consider a text with three symbols ${A, B, C}$ and probabilities ${0.5, 0.25, 0.25}$:

$$ H = - \left( 0.5 \log_2 0.5 + 0.25 \log_2 0.25 + 0.25 \log_2 0.25 \right) $$
$$ = - \left( 0.5 \times (-1) + 0.25 \times (-2) + 0.25 \times (-2) \right) $$
$$ = 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.5 , \text{bits}/\text{symbol} $$
Huffman coding assigns variable-length codes (e.g., A: 0, B: 10, C: 11), achieving an average length close to 1.5 bits/symbol for a reversible compression scheme.

Entropy Change: In a lossless compression scheme, the compressed data retains the source’s entropy, with no information loss. The entropy of the compressed message equals the source entropy, as decompression recovers the original data exactly.
Constant Entropy Interpretation: The Constant Entropy model views compression as maintaining total entropy. The compressed form’s reduced entropy (due to a more compact representation) is balanced by potential entropy in the decompression process, which requires the coding scheme to reconstruct the original message. This is analogous to a thermodynamic system where entropy shifts maintain a constant total, with no net loss of potential. The model highlights the conservation of information, reinforcing its applicability to computational systems where entropy management is critical.

5. Unifying Perspectives
The Constant Entropy model unifies thermodynamic and computational systems by interpreting entropy changes as conserved shifts within a constant total. In thermodynamics, standard calculations remain unchanged, but the model reframes entropy increases as losses in future potential, akin to heat death’s indistinguishability. In information theory, it aligns with systems where information is preserved, such as reversible computing or cryptographic protocols, emphasizing entropy conservation through redistribution.
5.1 Comparison with Standard Models

Thermodynamics: Standard calculations use state variables to compute entropy changes, such as:

$$ \Delta S_{\text{system}} = n C_v \ln \left( \frac{T_2}{T_1} \right) + n R \ln \left( \frac{V_2}{V_1} \right) $$
for ideal gases, or standard entropy changes ($\Delta S^\circ$) for chemical reactions. Irreversible processes increase system entropy, as dictated by the second law (Second law of thermodynamics). The Constant Entropy model does not alter these calculations but reinterprets them as shifts within a conserved total, offering a philosophical lens that emphasizes conservation akin to energy.

Information Theory: Shannon entropy assumes known computations, with entropy managed through data. For example, a source with probabilities $p_i$ has entropy:

$$ H = -\sum_{i} p_i \log_2 p_i $$
The Constant Entropy model emphasizes conservation, particularly in reversible computing or cryptographic systems where information is preserved, aligning with Landauer’s principle, which quantifies the entropy cost of erasing information (Landauer’s principle).

5.3 Implications and Applications

Cryptography: The model clarifies how zero-knowledge proofs maintain security by conserving entropy, as the high entropy of the secret key balances the certainty of the proof. This insight could guide the design of efficient cryptographic protocols, optimizing entropy management (Zero-knowledge proof).
Complex Systems: In biological or ecological systems, where physical and informational entropy interplay, the model could provide a framework for modeling order-disorder dynamics, such as metabolic processes or ecosystem stability (Entropy and life).
Quantum Information: The model’s focus on entropy conservation may extend to quantum systems, where maintaining coherence is critical, potentially informing quantum computing or communication protocols (Quantum information).
Energy Efficiency: By framing thermodynamic processes as entropy shifts, the model could inspire strategies to minimize exergy destruction in engineering systems, aligning with sustainable design principles (Exergy).

5.4 Areas for Further Research

Quantifying Future Potential Entropy: Developing methods to measure or estimate future potential entropy in physical systems, potentially by analogy to exergy or information content.
Computational Entropy Models: Formulating refined computational entropy models that explicitly incorporate the Constant Entropy framework, particularly for cryptographic or reversible systems.
Interdisciplinary Applications: Exploring the model’s applicability to quantum mechanics, network science, or socio-technical systems, where entropy plays a role in complexity and organization.
Empirical Validation: Conducting experiments or simulations to test the model’s predictions in physical and computational contexts, such as measuring entropy shifts in reversible computing implementations.

6. General Formula for Entropy Accumulation
The Constant Entropy model leverages existing formulas for entropy calculations, reinterpreting them as shifts within a conserved total. Below are the key formulas for both thermodynamic and computational systems, formatted for clarity and portability with KaTeX-compatible LaTeX.
6.1 Thermodynamic Systems

Exergy Calculation:

$$ E_x = (U - U_0) + P_0 (V - V_0) - T_0 (S - S_0) $$
where $E_x$ is the exergy, $U$, $V$, $S$ are the system’s internal energy, volume, and entropy, and $U_0$, $V_0$, $S_0$ are equilibrium values at environmental temperature $T_0$ and pressure $P_0$.

Entropy Change for Ideal Gases:

$$ \Delta S_{\text{system}} = n C_v \ln \left( \frac{T_2}{T_1} \right) + n R \ln \left( \frac{V_2}{V_1} \right) $$
where $n$ is the number of moles, $C_v$ is the molar heat capacity at constant volume, $R$ is the gas constant, $T_1$, $T_2$ are initial and final temperatures, and $V_1$, $V_2$ are initial and final volumes.

Maximum System Entropy (Free Expansion):

For an ideal gas expanding freely with no work done ($W = 0$, $Q = 0$):
$$ \Delta S_{\text{max}} = n R \ln \left( \frac{V_2}{V_1} \right) $$
This represents the maximum entropy increase for a given volume change, as all exergy is dissipated into disorder.

Chemical Reactions:

For reactions, entropy change is determined by standard molar entropies or the reversible heat transfer:
$$ \Delta S = \int \frac{dQ_{\text{rev}}}{T} $$
For a specific reaction like methane combustion, use standard entropy change:
$$ \Delta S^\circ = \sum S^\circ_{\text{products}} - \sum S^\circ_{\text{reactants}} $$
e.g., $\Delta S^\circ = -242.8 , \text{J}/(\text{mol} \cdot \text{K})$ for methane combustion.
6.2 Computational Systems
For computational systems, a refined formula models entropy conservation, incorporating dimensionality, verifiable entropy, secret entropy, and equivalence:
$$ H(n) = D \log_2 K + H_{Cv}(n) + H_{Cs} + \log_2 E(n) $$
where:

$D$: Dimensionality of the system (e.g., 1 for real-valued data, 2 for complex).
$K$: Number of states per dimension (e.g., $K = 2$ for binary).
$H_{Cv}(n)$: Verifiable entropy, decreasing with iterations $n$ as information is revealed (e.g., proof verification).
$H_{Cs}$: Secret entropy, constant (e.g., key entropy, such as 256 bits for a cryptographic key).
$E(n)$: Equivalence, the number of equivalent computations producing the same outcome, decreasing with iterations $n$.

The model ensures conservation:
$$ H_{\text{total}} = H_{\text{system}} + H_{\text{potential}}, \quad \Delta H_{\text{system}} = -\Delta H_{\text{potential}} $$
This formula captures the shift from potential uncertainty (e.g., unknown key) to actual certainty (e.g., verified proof), maintaining constant total entropy.
7. Python Implementation for Ideal Gas Entropy Calculation

8. Challenges and Considerations
Several challenges and considerations arise when applying the Constant Entropy model across thermodynamic and computational systems:

Thermodynamic Applicability: The Constant Entropy model is not standard in thermodynamics, where system entropy changes are process-specific and typically increase in irreversible processes, as mandated by the second law (Second law of thermodynamics). The model’s framework, which assumes a conserved total entropy by including future potential entropy, applies more readily to computational systems where entropy is conserved through information management (Point 12, 74). In physical systems, the abstract nature of future potential entropy requires further theoretical development to align with measurable quantities like exergy.
Future Potential Entropy: Quantifying future potential entropy in physical systems is challenging, as it lacks a direct measurable analog, unlike exergy or thermodynamic entropy. In computational systems, it is more intuitive, corresponding to hidden information (e.g., a cryptographic key) or potential processing capacity. Developing a rigorous definition or proxy for future potential entropy in thermodynamics could enhance the model’s applicability (Exergy).
Formula Accuracy: Standard thermodynamic formulas, such as:

$$ \Delta S_{\text{system}} = n C_v \ln \left( \frac{T_2}{T_1} \right) + n R \ln \left( \frac{V_2}{V_1} \right) $$
and information-theoretic formulas, such as:
$$ H = -\sum_{i} p_i \log_2 p_i $$
remain accurate and unchanged. The Constant Entropy model does not propose new formulas but reinterprets these calculations as shifts within a conserved total. For computational systems, the model inspires refined formulas, such as:
$$ H(n) = D \log_2 K + H_{Cv}(n) + H_{Cs} + \log_2 E(n) $$
to quantify entropy redistribution, potentially improving models for security or efficiency in cryptographic or reversible systems (Point 74).

Process Dependence: Entropy changes are highly process-specific, varying significantly between processes. For example, free expansion yields $\Delta S = 5.76 , \text{J}/\text{K}$ for the gas expansion case, while methane combustion results in $\Delta S = -242.8 , \text{J}/(\text{mol} \cdot \text{K})$ due to the reaction’s stoichiometry. This dependence requires careful application of the model to ensure consistency across different systems and contexts (Entropy).
Rendering Consistency: The use of LaTeX for formulas ensures mathematical precision but requires a Markdown renderer with KaTeX support. This document uses KaTeX-compatible commands (e.g., \ln, \cdot, \frac) and standard delimiters ($, $$) to ensure portability across platforms like VS Code with the Markdown+Math extension.

9. Conclusion
The Constant Entropy model re-contextualizes entropy as a conserved quantity, balancing system entropy with future potential entropy to maintain a constant total. Through detailed thermodynamic examples, such as ideal gas expansion and methane combustion, and computational examples, including zero-knowledge proofs, reversible computing, and data compression, the model demonstrates consistency with standard calculations while offering a unified perspective across physical and informational domains. The model’s reinterpretation of entropy changes as shifts from future possibilities to past actualities provides a novel lens for understanding entropy conservation, with potential applications in cryptography, complex systems, quantum information, and energy efficiency.
By reintegrating detailed calculations, formulas, and tables from prior document versions, formatted in KaTeX-compatible LaTeX for Markdown rendering, this paper ensures a comprehensive presentation of the research conducted. The model enriches conceptual understanding, bridging thermodynamics and information theory, though further research is needed to quantify future potential entropy in physical systems and validate the model empirically. For readers with thermodynamics and information theory backgrounds, this framework offers a rigorous yet accessible exploration of entropy as a conserved, dynamic quantity, fostering new insights into the interplay of order and disorder across diverse systems.
