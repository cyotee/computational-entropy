# Calculating Local Constant Entropy in Closed Systems

This exploration addresses the calculation of available energy and maximum entropy in a closed thermodynamic system, focusing on resolving the apparent contradiction between standard thermodynamic entropy increases and the user’s constant entropy model, which treats entropy changes as a translation of constant entropy from future to past. We provide a comprehensive framework with simple and complex examples, incorporating thermodynamic principles and the user’s computational perspective, to illustrate these calculations and assess whether this reconciliation enables more accurate formulas.

## Available Energy in Closed Systems

In thermodynamics, a closed system exchanges energy (as heat or work) but not matter with its surroundings, as described in [Closed system - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_system). The **available energy** is the maximum useful work a system can perform, quantified as **exergy**, the work obtainable as the system reaches equilibrium with its environment reversibly ([Exergy - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exergy)). Exergy depends on the system’s state (e.g., temperature \( T \), pressure \( P \), internal energy \( U \)) relative to the environment’s state (\( T_0 \), \( P_0 \), \( U_0 \)) and is given by:

\[
E_x = (U - U_0) + P_0 (V - V_0) - T_0 (S - S_0)
\]

where \( U \), \( V \), and \( S \) are the system’s internal energy, volume, and entropy, and \( U_0 \), \( V_0 \), \( S_0 \) are the equilibrium values. Exergy represents the system’s potential to do work, diminishing as it approaches equilibrium.

The **energy balance** for a closed system, per [Energy Balance for Closed Systems – Thermodynamics](https://eng.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Mechanical_Engineering/Introduction_to_Engineering_Thermodynamics_(Yan)/03%3A_Evaluation_of_Properties/3.03%3A_Energy_Balance_for_Closed_Systems), is:

\[
\Delta U = Q - W
\]

where \( \Delta U \) is the change in internal energy, \( Q \) is heat added, and \( W \) is work done by the system. For stationary systems, kinetic and potential energies are often constant, simplifying to internal energy changes.

## Maximum Entropy Accumulation

Entropy, a measure of disorder, increases in irreversible processes per the second law of thermodynamics ([Second law of thermodynamics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics)). The user’s query focuses on the maximum entropy a closed system can accumulate, particularly when energy is expended, possibly inefficiently, as work. The **maximum entropy** typically occurs when exergy is fully dissipated as heat, maximizing disorder, rather than converted to work. This is exemplified in free expansion for an ideal gas, where no work is done (\( W = 0 \)), and all exergy is destroyed (\( E_d = E_x \)), yielding the maximum system entropy increase:

\[
S_{\text{gen}} = \frac{E_d}{T_0}
\]

where \( E_d \) is the exergy destroyed, and \( T_0 \) is the environment temperature. The user’s clarification suggests that this maximum entropy, as seen in free expansion, is a reasonable upper bound, even when considering “abstract work” that approaches zero output due to extreme inefficiency.

## Resolving the Constant Entropy Contradiction

The user’s constant entropy model, articulated in prior discussions (Points 2, 30, 39), posits that entropy is constant but unevenly distributed over time, shifting from future potentials to past actualities, akin to a waveform collapse in quantum mechanics (Point 2). This contrasts with standard thermodynamics, where a closed system’s entropy typically increases during irreversible processes, such as inefficient work, challenging the constant entropy idea (Point 74). The user proposes resolving this by treating entropy changes as a translation of constant entropy from future to past, suggesting that the system’s entropy increase is offset by a decrease in some “future potential” entropy, maintaining a constant total.

### Thermodynamic Perspective
In standard thermodynamics, for a closed system:
- **Reversible Processes**: Entropy remains constant in reversible adiabatic processes (\( \Delta S_{\text{system}} = 0 \)), as seen in reversible gas expansion.
- **Irreversible Processes**: Entropy increases (\( \Delta S_{\text{system}} > 0 \)), as in irreversible expansion or free expansion, due to inefficiencies.
- **Universe**: The total entropy of the system plus surroundings always increases or remains constant (\( \Delta S_{\text{total}} \geq 0 \)).

The user’s model seems to conflict with irreversible processes, where system entropy grows. However, by defining a broader system that includes the physical system and an abstract “future potential” entropy, the contradiction can be resolved conceptually. As the system’s entropy increases (e.g., during free expansion), the future potential entropy decreases by an equivalent amount, keeping the total entropy constant. This is analogous to information-theoretic models, such as zero-knowledge proofs, where secrets act as entropy sinks, absorbing uncertainty to maintain constant total entropy while providing certainty about computational validity (Point 74).

### Computational and Information-Theoretic Perspective
In computational contexts, particularly zero-knowledge proofs ([Zero-knowledge proof - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof)), entropy is managed by redistributing uncertainty. The secret key’s high entropy (\( H_{Cs} \)) remains constant, while the proof’s verifiable entropy (\( H_{Cv} \)) reduces to zero upon verification, suggesting a conservation of total entropy (Point 12, 74). The user’s model extends this to physical systems, proposing that entropy shifts from future possibilities (potential states) to past actualities (realized states), maintaining a constant total. This aligns with reversible computing, where operations conserve information, avoiding entropy increases per [Landauer’s principle - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landauer%27s_principle).

### Does It Resolve the Contradiction?
Yes, treating entropy changes as a translation of constant entropy from future to past resolves the contradiction by redefining the system to include a notional “future potential” entropy. When a closed system’s entropy increases (e.g., \( \Delta S = 5.76 \, \text{J/K} \) in free expansion), the future potential entropy decreases by the same amount, keeping the total constant. This is not standard in thermodynamics, where system entropy changes are process-specific, but it is a valid conceptual framework in computational and information-theoretic contexts, where entropy can be conserved through redistribution (e.g., in reversible computations or cryptographic systems).

### Impact on Formulas
The reconciliation does not alter standard thermodynamic formulas for physical systems, as they accurately describe entropy changes based on measurable state variables (e.g., temperature, volume). However, it inspires potential refinements in computational models, where entropy conservation is modeled through identity loss or uncertainty redistribution. For physical systems, existing formulas suffice, but for computational systems like zero-knowledge proofs or reversible computing, new formulas could quantify how entropy shifts between verifiable and secret components, enhancing precision in modeling information flow and security.

## Simple Example: Ideal Gas Adiabatic Expansion

Consider 1 mole of a monatomic ideal gas (\( C_v = \frac{3}{2} R \), \( R = 8.314 \, \text{J/(mol·K)} \)) in a closed system with a piston, expanding adiabatically from 1 m³ to 2 m³ at an initial temperature of 300 K. We calculate the available energy and entropy change for reversible, irreversible, and free expansion scenarios to illustrate the range of entropy accumulation and assess the constant entropy model.

### Reversible Adiabatic Expansion
- **Available Energy (Exergy)**: The exergy is the maximum work, equal to the work done in a reversible adiabatic process (\( Q = 0 \)):

\[
W_{\text{rev}} = \Delta U = n C_v (T_1 - T_2)
\]

where \( T_2 = T_1 \left( \frac{V_1}{V_2} \right)^{\gamma - 1} \), and \( \gamma = \frac{C_p}{C_v} = \frac{5/3}{3/2} = \frac{5}{3} \). For \( T_1 = 300 \, \text{K} \), \( V_1 = 1 \, \text{m}^3 \), \( V_2 = 2 \, \text{m}^3 \):

\[
T_2 = 300 \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{2/3} \approx 189 \, \text{K}
\]

\[
W_{\text{rev}} = 1 \times \frac{3}{2} \times 8.314 \times (300 - 189) \approx 1385 \, \text{J}
\]

- **Entropy Change**: Since the process is reversible and adiabatic, no heat is exchanged, and the system’s entropy change is zero:

\[
\Delta S_{\text{system}} = 0
\]

- **Constant Entropy Interpretation**: In the user’s model, the system’s entropy remains constant, and no future potential entropy is translated, as the process is fully reversible, preserving all potential for work. The total entropy (system + future potential) is constant because no disorder is generated.

### Irreversible Adiabatic Expansion
- **Setup**: The gas expands against a constant external pressure \( P_{\text{ext}} = 0.5 P_1 \), where \( P_1 = \frac{n R T_1}{V_1} = \frac{1 \times 8.314 \times 300}{1} = 2494.2 \, \text{Pa} \), so \( P_{\text{ext}} = 1247.1 \, \text{Pa} \).
- **Work Done**:

\[
W = P_{\text{ext}} (V_2 - V_1) = 1247.1 \times (2 - 1) = 1247.1 \, \text{J}
\]

- **Temperature Change**: Since \( Q = 0 \), \( \Delta U = -W \):

\[
\Delta U = n C_v (T_2 - T_1) = -W
\]

\[
1 \times \frac{3}{2} \times 8.314 \times (T_2 - 300) = -1247.1
\]

\[
T_2 = 300 - \frac{1247.1}{\frac{3}{2} \times 8.314} \approx 200.04 \, \text{K}
\]

- **Entropy Change**:

\[
\Delta S_{\text{system}} = n C_v \ln \left( \frac{T_2}{T_1} \right) + n R \ln \left( \frac{V_2}{V_1} \right)
\]

\[
= 1 \times \frac{3}{2} \times 8.314 \times \ln \left( \frac{200.04}{300} \right) + 1 \times 8.314 \times \ln 2
\]

\[
\approx \frac{3}{2} \times 8.314 \times (-0.4055) + 8.314 \times 0.6931 \approx -5.05 + 5.76 = 0.71 \, \text{J/K}
\]

- **Constant Entropy Interpretation**: The system’s entropy increases by 0.71 J/K due to irreversibility, reflecting inefficiency. In the user’s model, this increase is balanced by a decrease in future potential entropy by 0.71 J/K, maintaining constant total entropy. The future potential represents the lost capacity for work due to inefficiency, translated into realized disorder.

### Free Expansion (No Work)
- **Setup**: The gas expands into a vacuum (\( W = 0 \)), with no heat transfer (\( Q = 0 \)).
- **Temperature**: For an ideal gas, \( \Delta U = 0 \), so \( T_2 = T_1 = 300 \, \text{K} \).
- **Entropy Change**:

\[
\Delta S_{\text{system}} = n R \ln \left( \frac{V_2}{V_1} \right) = 1 \times 8.314 \times \ln 2 \approx 5.76 \, \text{J/K}
\]

- **Constant Entropy Interpretation**: This represents the maximum system entropy change for the volume doubling, as all exergy is dissipated internally, maximizing disorder. In the user’s model, the future potential entropy decreases by 5.76 J/K, as all potential for work is converted to disorder, keeping total entropy constant. This aligns with the user’s clarification that free expansion’s entropy is a reasonable maximum, even for “abstract work” approaching zero output.

## Complex Example: Chemical Reaction in a Closed System

Consider methane combustion in a sealed container with a piston: \( \text{CH}_4 + 2 \text{O}_2 \to \text{CO}_2 + 2 \text{H}_2\text{O} \). The reaction releases chemical energy, some of which can be converted to work via expansion, with entropy changes depending on process efficiency.

### Reversible Combustion Process
- **Available Energy (Exergy)**: The maximum work is the negative Gibbs free energy change, \( -\Delta G \), at 298 K, 1 atm:

\[
\Delta H^\circ = -890.3 \, \text{kJ/mol}, \quad \Delta S^\circ = -242.8 \, \text{J/(mol·K)}
\]

\[
\Delta G^\circ = \Delta H^\circ - T \Delta S^\circ = -890.3 \times 10^3 - 298 \times (-242.8) \approx -818.0 \, \text{kJ/mol}
\]

Maximum work: \( W_{\text{max}} = -\Delta G^\circ = 818.0 \, \text{kJ/mol} \).

- **Entropy Change**: The system’s entropy decreases due to more ordered products:

\[
\Delta S_{\text{system}} = -242.8 \, \text{J/(mol·K)}
\]

Surroundings’ entropy increases:

\[
\Delta S_{\text{surr}} = \frac{-\Delta H^\circ}{T_0} = \frac{890.3 \times 10^3}{298} \approx 2987.6 \, \text{J/(mol·K)}
\]

\[
\Delta S_{\text{total}} = -242.8 + 2987.6 \approx 2744.8 \, \text{J/(mol·K)} > 0
\]

- **Constant Entropy Interpretation**: The system’s entropy decreases, but the universe’s entropy increases. In the user’s model, the system’s entropy decrease is offset by an increase in future potential entropy, as the reaction’s order preserves potential for future processes, maintaining constant total entropy.

### Irreversible Combustion Process
- **Setup**: Assume only 50% of the maximum work is done:

\[
W = 0.5 \times 818.0 = 409.0 \, \text{kJ/mol}
\]

- **Heat Released**:

\[
Q = \Delta H^\circ + W = -890.3 + 409.0 = -481.3 \, \text{kJ/mol}
\]

- **Entropy Change**: System entropy remains approximately \( \Delta S_{\text{system}} = -242.8 \, \text{J/(mol·K)} \). Surroundings’ entropy:

\[
\Delta S_{\text{surr}} = \frac{-Q}{T_0} = \frac{481.3 \times 10^3}{298} \approx 1615.1 \, \text{J/(mol·K)}
\]

\[
\Delta S_{\text{total}} = -242.8 + 1615.1 \approx 1372.3 \, \text{J/(mol·K)} > 0
\]

- **Constant Entropy Interpretation**: The system’s entropy decrease is consistent, but less work increases total entropy generation. The user’s model posits that the future potential entropy adjusts to balance this, with less potential preserved due to inefficiency.

### Maximum Entropy in the Complex Example
Maximizing system entropy for a chemical reaction is complex, as \( \Delta S_{\text{system}} \) is fixed by the reaction’s thermodynamics unless the final state changes. If no work is done, and all energy is released as heat, \( \Delta S_{\text{system}} = -242.8 \, \text{J/(mol·K)} \), but surroundings’ entropy maximizes:

\[
\Delta S_{\text{surr}} = 2987.6 \, \text{J/(mol·K)}
\]

\[
\Delta S_{\text{total}} = 2744.8 \, \text{J/(mol·K)}
\]

To maximize \( \Delta S_{\text{system}} \), the system would need a disordered state (e.g., unreacted mixture), but this deviates from combustion. The user’s “abstract work” interpretation suggests minimal work output, where system entropy remains reaction-specific, but total entropy reflects inefficiency.

## Computational Example: Zero-Knowledge Proof

In zero-knowledge proofs, a computational process proves a statement’s validity without revealing inputs, such as a secret key. Consider a cryptographic signature verification:

- **Available Energy (Information)**: The exergy is the information content of the inputs, including the secret key’s entropy (e.g., 256 bits for a secure key).
- **Work Done**: The computational work verifies the signature, producing a proof that is certain (validity confirmed).
- **Entropy Change**: The system’s entropy splits into:
  - **Verifiable Entropy (\( H_{Cv} \))**: Reduces to zero upon verification, as the proof is certain.
  - **Secret Entropy (\( H_{Cs} \))**: Remains high (e.g., \( H_{Cs} = 256 \) bits), as the key is not revealed.

- **Constant Entropy Interpretation**: The total entropy is constant, with the secret key acting as an entropy sink (Point 74). The entropy increase in the verifiable part (certainty gained) is balanced by the key’s persistent uncertainty, translating future potential (key’s secrecy) to past actuality (proof’s validity).

- **Maximum Entropy**: The maximum system entropy is the key’s entropy if no verification occurs, but in ZK proofs, the process maintains constant entropy by redistributing uncertainty, aligning with the user’s model.

## General Formula for Entropy Accumulation

Standard thermodynamic formulas for entropy change remain accurate for physical systems:

1. **Exergy Calculation**:

\[
E_x = (U - U_0) + P_0 (V - V_0) - T_0 (S - S_0)
\]

2. **Work Done**: Process-specific (e.g., \( W = P_{\text{ext}} \Delta V \) for expansion).

3. **Entropy Change**: For ideal gases:

\[
\Delta S_{\text{system}} = n C_v \ln \left( \frac{T_2}{T_1} \right) + n R \ln \left( \frac{V_2}{V_1} \right)
\]

For reactions, use standard entropy changes or:

\[
\Delta S = \int \frac{dQ_{\text{rev}}}{T}
\]

**Maximum System Entropy**: Achieved in free expansion for gases (\( W = 0 \)):

\[
\Delta S_{\text{max}} = n R \ln \left( \frac{V_2}{V_1} \right)
\]

For computational systems, a refined formula could model entropy as:

\[
H(n) = D \log_2 K + H_{Cv}(n) + H_{Cs} + \log_2 E(n)
\]

where:
- \( D \): Dimensionality (e.g., 1 for real, 2 for complex).
- \( H_{Cv}(n) \): Verifiable entropy, decreasing with iterations \( n \).
- \( H_{Cs} \): Secret entropy, constant (e.g., key entropy).
- \( E(n) \): Equivalence, decreasing with \( n \).

In the user’s model, \( H_{\text{total}} = H_{\text{system}} + H_{\text{potential}} \), with \( \Delta H_{\text{system}} = -\Delta H_{\text{potential}} \), ensuring constant total entropy.

## Challenges and Considerations

- **Thermodynamic Applicability**: The constant entropy model is not standard in thermodynamics, where system entropy changes are process-specific. The user’s framework applies more readily to computational systems where entropy is conserved through information management (Point 12, 74).
- **Future Potential Entropy**: Defining and quantifying “future potential” entropy is challenging in physical systems, lacking a direct analog, but is intuitive in computational contexts like reversible computing or cryptography ([Reversible computing - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversible_computing)).
- **Formula Accuracy**: Standard formulas are accurate for physical systems. The user’s model may enable refined formulas for computational entropy, quantifying shifts between verifiable and secret components, potentially improving models for security or efficiency (Point 74).
- **Process Dependence**: Entropy changes vary (e.g., \( \Delta S = 0 \) for reversible adiabatic vs. \( \Delta S = 5.76 \, \text{J/K} \) for free expansion), requiring process-specific calculations ([Entropy - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy)).
