# Constant Entropy: A Unified Perspective on Thermodynamic and Computational Systems

## Introduction

Entropy serves as a fundamental concept bridging thermodynamics and information theory, quantifying disorder in physical systems and uncertainty in informational systems. In thermodynamics, entropy measures the unavailability of energy for work, governed by the second law, which states that the total entropy of a closed system and its surroundings never decreases ([Second law of thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics)). In information theory, Shannon entropy quantifies the unpredictability of a message, reflecting the information needed to resolve uncertainty ([Entropy (information theory)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory))). Despite their distinct domains, both share a common theme: entropy reflects the loss of structure or predictability.

The **Constant Entropy model** proposes a re-contextualization of entropy calculations, suggesting that the total entropy of a system, when augmented by an abstract "future potential" entropy, remains constant over time. Unlike traditional thermodynamics, where a closed system’s entropy often increases during irreversible processes, or information theory, where entropy is managed through data processing, this model posits that any entropy increase in the system is balanced by a decrease in future potential entropy, representing the system’s capacity for order or work. This framework unifies physical and computational perspectives, offering insights into systems ranging from gas expansions to cryptographic protocols.

This paper provides a rigorous explanation of the Constant Entropy model for readers with backgrounds in thermodynamics and information theory, integrating detailed examples and calculations from physical systems (ideal gas expansion, methane combustion) and computational systems (zero-knowledge proofs). We reintroduce formula examples and tables from earlier iterations, ensuring consistency with the model’s definitions, to demonstrate how entropy shifts are calculated and interpreted. By relating the model to existing thermodynamic and information-theoretic frameworks, we aim to clarify its application without redefining entropy itself, supported by citations to established literature.

## The Constant Entropy Model

### Definition and Core Principles

The Constant Entropy model asserts that the total entropy of a system, encompassing both its measurable entropy and an abstract future potential entropy, is conserved over time. In thermodynamics, a closed system’s entropy typically increases during irreversible processes due to increased disorder ([Closed system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_system)). The model reinterprets this increase as a transfer from future potential entropy—the system’s latent capacity for order or work—to actual entropy, reflecting realized disorder. This shift is conceptualized as a translation from future possibilities to past actualities, maintaining a constant total entropy.

Key principles include:
- **Entropy Conservation**: Total entropy (\( H_{\text{total}} = H_{\text{system}} + H_{\text{potential}} \)) remains constant, with \( \Delta H_{\text{system}} = -\Delta H_{\text{potential}} \).
- **Future Potential Entropy**: Represents the system’s potential states or order, decreasing as actual entropy increases.
- **Past Actuality**: The realized disorder or certainty in the system’s current state, increasing as potential is exhausted.
- **Interdisciplinary Application**: The model applies to both physical systems (e.g., gas expansion) and computational systems (e.g., zero-knowledge proofs), unifying thermodynamic and information-theoretic perspectives.

This framework draws inspiration from computational systems, where entropy is conserved through information redistribution, as in reversible computing ([Reversible computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversible_computing)) or cryptographic protocols ([Zero-knowledge proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof)). In physical systems, future potential entropy is abstract, akin to the system’s exergy ([Exergy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exergy)), which diminishes as entropy increases, aligning with heat death concepts ([Heat death of the universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_death_of_the_universe)).

### Relation to Standard Models

**Thermodynamics**: Standard calculations use state variables (e.g., temperature, volume) to compute entropy changes, which increase in irreversible processes. The Constant Entropy model does not alter these calculations but reframes them as shifts within a conserved total, offering a philosophical lens rather than a new formula.

**Information Theory**: Shannon entropy assumes known computations, with entropy managed through data processing. The model emphasizes conservation, particularly in systems where information is preserved, such as reversible computing or cryptography, aligning with Landauer’s principle ([Landauer’s principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landauer%27s_principle)).

## Thermodynamic Applications

### Ideal Gas Expansion

Consider 1 mole of a monatomic ideal gas (\( C_v = \frac{3}{2} R \), \( R = 8.314 \, \text{J/(mol·K)} \)) in an isolated system, expanding from 1 m³ to 2 m³ at 300 K. We analyze three processes to illustrate entropy changes and their interpretation under the Constant Entropy model.

#### Reversible Adiabatic Expansion
- **Process**: The gas expands slowly, doing maximum work without heat exchange (\( Q = 0 \)).
- **Available Energy (Exergy)**: Maximum work is:

\[
W_{\text{rev}} = \Delta U = n C_v (T_1 - T_2)
\]

\[
T_2 = T_1 \left( \frac{V_1}{V_2} \right)^{\gamma - 1}, \quad \gamma = \frac{5}{3}
\]

\[
T_2 = 300 \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{2/3} \approx 189 \, \text{K}
\]

\[
W_{\text{rev}} = 1 \times \frac{3}{2} \times 8.314 \times (300 - 189) \approx 1385 \, \text{J}
\]

- **Entropy Change**: Reversible and adiabatic, so:

\[
\Delta S_{\text{system}} = 0
\]

- **Constant Entropy Interpretation**: No entropy is generated, preserving future potential entropy. Total entropy remains constant, as no disorder is added.

#### Irreversible Adiabatic Expansion
- **Process**: Expansion against constant external pressure \( P_{\text{ext}} = 0.5 P_1 \), where \( P_1 = \frac{n R T_1}{V_1} = 2494.2 \, \text{Pa} \), so \( P_{\text{ext}} = 1247.1 \, \text{Pa} \).
- **Work Done**:

\[
W = P_{\text{ext}} (V_2 - V_1) = 1247.1 \times 1 = 1247.1 \, \text{J}
\]

- **Temperature Change**:

\[
\Delta U = -W = n C_v (T_2 - T_1)
\]

\[
T_2 = 300 - \frac{1247.1}{\frac{3}{2} \times 8.314} \approx 200.04 \, \text{K}
\]

- **Entropy Change**:

\[
\Delta S_{\text{system}} = n C_v \ln \left( \frac{T_2}{T_1} \right) + n R \ln \left( \frac{V_2}{V_1} \right)
\]

\[
\approx 1 \times \frac{3}{2} \times 8.314 \times \ln \left( \frac{200.04}{300} \right) + 1 \times 8.314 \times \ln 2 \approx -5.05 + 5.76 = 0.71 \, \text{J/K}
\]

- **Constant Entropy Interpretation**: The system’s entropy increases by 0.71 J/K, balanced by a 0.71 J/K decrease in future potential entropy, reflecting lost work capacity due to inefficiency.

#### Free Expansion
- **Process**: Expansion into a vacuum (\( W = 0 \), \( Q = 0 \)).
- **Temperature**: \( \Delta U = 0 \), so \( T_2 = T_1 = 300 \, \text{K} \).
- **Entropy Change**:

\[
\Delta S_{\text{system}} = n R \ln \left( \frac{V_2}{V_1} \right) = 1 \times 8.314 \times \ln 2 \approx 5.76 \, \text{J/K}
\]

- **Constant Entropy Interpretation**: This maximum entropy increase exhausts the system’s potential for order, decreasing future potential entropy by 5.76 J/K, akin to heat death where molecules are indistinguishable across the volume.

### Chemical Reaction: Methane Combustion

Consider methane combustion: \( \text{CH}_4 + 2 \text{O}_2 \to \text{CO}_2 + 2 \text{H}_2\text{O} \).

#### Reversible Process
- **Available Energy**: Maximum work is:

\[
\Delta H^\circ = -890.3 \, \text{kJ/mol}, \quad \Delta S^\circ = -242.8 \, \text{J/(mol·K)}
\]

\[
\Delta G^\circ = -890.3 \times 10^3 - 298 \times (-242.8) \approx -818.0 \, \text{kJ/mol}
\]

\[
W_{\text{max}} = 818.0 \, \text{kJ/mol}
\]

- **Entropy Change**:

\[
\Delta S_{\text{system}} = -242.8 \, \text{J/(mol·K)}
\]

\[
\Delta S_{\text{surr}} = \frac{-\Delta H^\circ}{298} \approx 2987.6 \, \text{J/(mol·K)}
\]

\[
\Delta S_{\text{total}} = -242.8 + 2987.6 \approx 2744.8 \, \text{J/(mol·K)}
\]

- **Constant Entropy Interpretation**: The system’s entropy decrease increases future potential entropy by 242.8 J/(mol·K), maintaining constant total entropy.

#### Irreversible Process (All Energy as Heat)
- **Setup**: \( W = 0 \), \( Q = \Delta H^\circ = -890.3 \, \text{kJ/mol} \).
- **Entropy Change**: \( \Delta S_{\text{system}} = -242.8 \, \text{J/(mol·K)} \), \( \Delta S_{\text{surr}} = 2987.6 \, \text{J/(mol·K)} \), \( \Delta S_{\text{total}} = 2744.8 \, \text{J/(mol·K)} \).
- **Constant Entropy Interpretation**: The fixed system entropy suggests a state-dependent transformation, with future potential entropy increasing to balance the decrease.

## Information-Theoretic Applications

### Zero-Knowledge Proof
In a zero-knowledge proof, a prover demonstrates a statement’s validity without revealing the secret key (e.g., 256-bit key, \( H_{Cs} = 256 \)).

- **Entropy Change**: Verifiable entropy (\( H_{Cv} \)) reduces to zero, while secret entropy (\( H_{Cs} \)) remains high.
- **Constant Entropy Interpretation**: Total entropy is conserved, with the key’s entropy balancing the proof’s certainty, translating future potential to past actuality.

### Reversible Computing
A Toffoli gate in reversible computing preserves information, maintaining constant entropy ([Reversible computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversible_computing)). The model interprets this as no shift in entropy, preserving future potential.
