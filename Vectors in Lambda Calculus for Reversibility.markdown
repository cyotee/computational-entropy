# Vectors in Lambda Calculus for Constraining Function Reversibility

This report explores the feasibility of incorporating vectors into lambda calculus to influence the information required to reverse a computation, particularly in the context of cryptographic functions. Lambda calculus, a formal system for expressing computation through function abstraction and application, is inherently reversible when all inputs are known, but cryptographic functions like one-way hashes require computational hardness to prevent inversion without a key. The user proposes using a vector, whose magnitude affects the information needed for reversibility, to model such functions in lambda calculus. By leveraging the vectorial λ-calculus, a typed extension that integrates linear-algebraic structures, we can encode vectors as keys and constrain reversibility, aligning with cryptographic principles. This note provides a comprehensive analysis, including theoretical foundations, practical examples, and limitations, drawing from recent sources and theoretical insights.

## Background: Lambda Calculus and Cryptographic Functions

### Lambda Calculus Overview
Lambda calculus, developed by Alonzo Church in the 1930s, is a universal model of computation capable of simulating any Turing machine ([Lambda Calculus - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus)). It consists of:
- **Variables**: Placeholders (e.g., \(x\)).
- **Abstractions**: Function definitions, denoted \(\lambda x.M\), where \(x\) is the input and \(M\) is the body.
- **Applications**: Applying a function to an argument, written \((M N)\).

Computation proceeds via **β-reduction**, substituting arguments into functions. In untyped lambda calculus, functions are generally reversible because each reduction can be traced back symbolically, assuming all inputs are known ([Defining a calculation-reversing function in the lambda calculus](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/20922/defining-a-calculation-reversing-function-in-the-lambda-calculus)).

### Cryptographic Functions and Reversibility
Cryptographic functions, such as one-way hashes or encryption schemes, are designed to be:
- **Easy to compute**: Given inputs (e.g., plaintext and key), the output (ciphertext) is efficiently produced.
- **Hard to invert**: Without the key, recovering the input from the output is computationally infeasible ([One-Way Function - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-way_function)).

In lambda calculus, a cryptographic function is reversible if the key is provided as an input variable, but without the key, it should be practically irreversible. The user’s query asks whether a vector, with its magnitude influencing the information needed for reversal, can model this behavior.

### Vectors and Linear Algebra
Vectors are elements of a vector space, represented as arrays of numbers (e.g., \([v_1, v_2]\) in \(\mathbb{R}^2\)) with magnitude (norm, e.g., \(\|\mathbf{v}\| = \sqrt{v_1^2 + v_2^2}\)) and direction. In linear algebra, transformations like \(f(\mathbf{v}) = A \cdot \mathbf{v}\) (where \(A\) is a matrix) are reversible if \(A\) is invertible, allowing the input \(\mathbf{v}\) to be recovered via \(A^{-1} \cdot (A \cdot \mathbf{v})\).

## The Vectorial λ-Calculus: A Bridge for Vectors

The **vectorial λ-calculus** is a typed extension of lambda calculus that incorporates linear-algebraic structures, making it ideal for encoding vectors and matrices ([The vectorial λ-calculus - ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890540117300482)). Key features include:
- **Vectors**: Represented as linear combinations of basis terms (e.g., \(\sum_i v_i \cdot e_i\)).
- **Matrices**: Encoded as functions transforming vectors, typed to ensure linear-algebraic properties.
- **Type System**: Tracks linear combinations, enabling static analysis of term reductions and ensuring properties like reversibility for invertible transformations.

### Encoding Vectors and Keys
In this calculus, a vector can represent a cryptographic key, and a function can combine this key with data. For example:
- **Key Vector**: \(\mathbf{v} = [v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k]\), where components are scalars (e.g., real numbers or finite field elements).
- **Data Vector**: \(\mathbf{w}\), representing the input (e.g., plaintext).
- **Function**: A lambda term \(f = \lambda \mathbf{v}. \lambda \mathbf{w}. (A \cdot \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w})\), where \(A\) is a matrix, combines the key and data.

### Reversibility and Information
- **Reversible Case**: If \(A\) is invertible, the function is reversible with \(\mathbf{v}\):
  \[
  \mathbf{w} = f(\mathbf{v}, \mathbf{w}) - A \cdot \mathbf{v}
  \]
  Here, the result \(f(\mathbf{v}, \mathbf{w})\) contains enough information to recover \(\mathbf{w}\) if \(\mathbf{v}\) is known, satisfying the user’s requirement that the result has at least as much information as the input variables.
- **Irreversible Without Key**: Without \(\mathbf{v}\), reversal is infeasible because many \(\mathbf{v}\) could produce the same output, especially if \(\mathbf{v}\) is drawn from a large space (high entropy).

### Magnitude’s Role
The user suggests that the vector’s magnitude influences the information needed for reversal. In linear algebra:
- **Magnitude**: The norm \(\|\mathbf{v}\|\) measures the vector’s size but doesn’t directly affect reversibility, which depends on \(A\)’s invertibility.
- **Information Content**: The information needed to reverse \(f\) is tied to \(\mathbf{v}\)’s entropy, determined by its possible values. A vector with many components (high dimensionality) or a large range increases entropy, making it harder to guess without additional data.
- **Indirect Influence**: A larger magnitude might imply a vector with more significant components, but in cryptography, security depends on the number of possible \(\mathbf{v}\) (e.g., \(2^k\) for a \(k\)-bit vector), not magnitude per se. For example, in a finite field like \(\text{GF}(2^k)\), all vectors have discrete components, and magnitude is less relevant than dimensionality.

## Modeling Cryptographic Functions
The user’s intuition is to define a function where reversibility requires more information than the result provides unless the key vector is known. This mirrors cryptographic encryption:
- **Function Definition**: In vectorial λ-calculus, define:
  \[
  f = \lambda \mathbf{v}. \lambda \mathbf{w}. (A \cdot \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w})
  \]
  where \(\mathbf{v}\) is the key and \(\mathbf{w}\) is the plaintext.
- **Reversal**: The inverse is:
  \[
  g = \lambda \mathbf{v}. \lambda \mathbf{y}. (\mathbf{y} - A \cdot \mathbf{v})
  \]
  where \(\mathbf{y} = f(\mathbf{v}, \mathbf{w})\). Without \(\mathbf{v}\), \(g\) cannot be computed.
- **Information in Result**: The result \(\mathbf{y}\) contains \(\mathbf{w}\)’s information but obscured by \(A \cdot \mathbf{v}\). If \(\mathbf{v}\) has high entropy (many possible values), \(\mathbf{y}\) alone doesn’t suffice to recover \(\mathbf{w}\), aligning with cryptographic hardness.

### Algebraic Reversibility
For an algebraically reversible function (e.g., \(f\) with an invertible \(A\)):
- The information needed to reverse is exactly \(\mathbf{v}\), matching the input variables’ information.
- The result \(\mathbf{y}\) has at least as much information as \(\mathbf{w}\) (since \(\mathbf{y} = A \cdot \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}\)), allowing recovery of \(\mathbf{w}\) with \(\mathbf{v}\).

### Cryptographic Hardness
To make \(f\) cryptographically secure:
- \(\mathbf{v}\) must be drawn from a large, uniform distribution (e.g., \(k\)-dimensional vectors over \(\text{GF}(2)\), with entropy \(k\) bits).
- The transformation \(A \cdot \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}\) should be designed to resist attacks (e.g., linear cryptanalysis), which is more about \(A\)’s structure than \(\mathbf{v}\)’s magnitude.

## Practical Example
Consider a simple vectorial λ-calculus function:
- **Vectors**: \(\mathbf{v}, \mathbf{w} \in \mathbb{R}^2\), \(A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{bmatrix}\), invertible (\(\det(A) = -2 \neq 0\)).
- **Function**: \(f = \lambda \mathbf{v}. \lambda \mathbf{w}. (A \cdot \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w})\).
- **Application**: For \(\mathbf{v} = [v_1, v_2]\), \(\mathbf{w} = [w_1, w_2]\), compute:
  \[
  f(\mathbf{v}, \mathbf{w}) = \begin{bmatrix} v_1 + 2v_2 + w_1 \\ 3v_1 + 4v_2 + w_2 \end{bmatrix}
  \]
- **Reversal**: Given \(\mathbf{y} = f(\mathbf{v}, \mathbf{w})\), compute:
  \[
  \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{y} - A \cdot \mathbf{v}
  \]
  Without \(\mathbf{v}\), \(\mathbf{y}\) could result from any \(\mathbf{v}\), making reversal infeasible.

If \(\mathbf{v}\) is chosen from a large space (e.g., \(10^6\) possible vectors), guessing \(\mathbf{v}\) requires significant information, akin to a cryptographic key.

## Limitations and Challenges
- **Magnitude vs. Entropy**: The user’s focus on magnitude may be a misnomer. In cryptography, security depends on the entropy of the key space (number of possible vectors), not the magnitude of a specific vector. Magnitude could play a role in continuous settings (e.g., real-valued vectors), but cryptographic keys are typically discrete.
- **Lambda Calculus Constraints**: Standard lambda calculus lacks computational hardness mechanisms, making it unsuitable for direct cryptographic definitions. The vectorial λ-calculus helps but is still theoretical.
- **Type System Complexity**: Ensuring reversibility via types requires sophisticated type systems, which may be impractical for large-scale applications.
- **Non-Linear Functions**: The vectorial λ-calculus excels with linear transformations, but cryptographic functions often involve non-linear operations, which are harder to model.

## Conclusion
Incorporating a vector into lambda calculus, particularly through the vectorial λ-calculus, allows for defining functions where reversibility depends on knowing the vector (key). The function can be algebraically reversible with the key, requiring only the input variables’ information, while being hard to invert without it due to the key’s entropy. The vector’s magnitude may indirectly influence this by affecting the key space’s size, but entropy is the primary driver in cryptographic contexts. This approach aligns with the user’s vision, offering a formal way to model cryptographic-like functions in lambda calculus, though practical cryptographic implementations require additional structures beyond lambda calculus’s symbolic framework.
