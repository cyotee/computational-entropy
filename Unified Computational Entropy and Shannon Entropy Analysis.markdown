By retaining all original content from each document, we ensure consistency and depth across the three, demonstrating how computational entropy formulas and estimation methods apply to games like the Weighing Problem, Game 63, and Submarine. This unified framework extends Shannon’s principles to computational processes, offering a robust tool for estimating unknowns in iterative, information-constrained scenarios.

Computational Entropy Estimation: Methods and Applications
Abstract
Computational entropy, analogous to thermodynamic entropy, quantifies the uncertainty or information content in computational processes. This paper explores methods to estimate computational entropy in scenarios where only partial information, such as a list of results and the number of iterations, is available, without knowledge of initial entropy, total iterations, or input distributions. Drawing from information theory, we evaluate five methods—Bayesian inference, maximum entropy principle, iterative entropy reconstruction, sequence-based entropy, and model selection with information criteria—for their utility in deriving probabilistic or statistical answers about unknown functions generating observed results. These methods are applied to contexts like the Weighing Problem, guessing games, and game show strategies (e.g., Jeopardy, Family Feud), where iterative information gain reduces uncertainty. We model computations in Lambda Calculus for precision and relate findings to Shannon Entropy, addressing the user’s analogy to an “Ideal Computation Law” and the entropy of function-to-function transformations. Formatted in KaTeX-compatible LaTeX for Markdown rendering in VS Code’s Markdown+Math extension, this comprehensive analysis targets readers with backgrounds in information theory, computational theory, and thermodynamics.
Introduction
Entropy, a measure of uncertainty, bridges thermodynamics and information theory. In thermodynamics, entropy quantifies disorder or unavailable energy (Second law of thermodynamics). In information theory, Shannon Entropy measures the average information required to predict a random variable’s outcome, defined as ( H(X) = -\sum_i P(x_i) \log_2 P(x_i) ) (Entropy (information theory)). Computational entropy extends this concept to quantify uncertainty in computational processes, particularly in iterative scenarios where each step reduces uncertainty through information gain.
The user seeks to estimate computational entropy in scenarios where only the results of a computation and the number of iterations are known, without initial entropy, total iterations, or input distributions. This inverse problem—determining which function produced observed results—requires probabilistic or statistical methods to infer unknowns, such as the function’s identity or the computation’s entropy. The user evaluates five methods from prior discussions:

Bayesian inference, likened to an “Ideal Computation Law” for finite function sets.
Maximum entropy principle, suited for simple functions like the successor function (SUCC).
Iterative entropy reconstruction, useful for partially known functions in strategic contexts like game shows.
Sequence-based entropy, for assessing result predictability without function knowledge.
Model selection with information criteria, for algebraic-like inference with partial computational knowledge.

The user draws parallels to thermodynamics, where entropy calculations vary by context, and suggests that computational entropy for function-to-function transformations may be measurable as a relative entropy delta, with methods estimating maximum or minimum entropy based on result information content. This paper expands on these ideas, modeling computations in Lambda Calculus (Lambda calculus) and relating findings to Shannon Entropy, addressing game show strategies and complex function entropy.
Methods for Estimating Computational Entropy

1. Bayesian Inference
Bayesian inference models the probability of candidate functions ( { f_1, f_2, \ldots, f_m } ) generating observed results ( R = { r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_k } ) over ( k ) iterations, using Bayes’ theorem:
[ P(f_i | R) = \frac{P(R | f_i) P(f_i)}{\sum_j P(R | f_j) P(f_j)} ]

Utility: Ideal for finite function sets, where each iteration reduces the set, akin to an “Ideal Computation Law” (Bayesian inference). The user compares this to the Ideal Gas Law, suggesting optimal partitioning under uniform result distributions, as in the Weighing Problem with 12 coins (24 scenarios, 3 weighings).

Entropy Calculation: The entropy of the function distribution is:
[ H(F | R) = -\sum_i P(f_i | R) \log_2 P(f_i | R) ]
Information gain is ( I = H(F) - H(F | R) ), where ( H(F) = \log_2 m ) for uniform priors.

Application: In the Weighing Problem, results like {balanced, left heavier, balanced} distinguish among functions modeling different coin counts (e.g., 12 vs. 13 coins). With uniform priors, ( P(f_i | R) ) updates based on likelihoods, reducing ( H(F | R) ).

Limitations: Requires a finite function set and assumptions about ( P(R | f_i) ), which is complex without input distributions.

2. Maximum Entropy Principle
The maximum entropy principle assumes the least informative distribution over possible scenarios or functions, maximizing entropy subject to constraints (Maximum entropy).

Utility: Suited for simple functions like the successor function (SUCC), where iterations quickly reveal uniform distributions. The user notes its utility for determining the likelihood of discovering the function per iteration, estimating iterations needed for certainty.

Entropy Calculation: Hypothesize ( N \leq M^k ) scenarios, where ( M ) is outcomes per query. Initial entropy:
[ H_0 \approx \log_2 N ]
Each iteration reduces entropy by up to ( \log_2 M ), summing to ( H_0 ).

Application: For SUCC (( f(x) = x + 1 )), results like {2, 3, 4} suggest a linear function. Assuming ( M = 2 ) (binary queries), ( k = 3 ), estimate ( N \leq 2^3 = 8 ), ( H_0 \approx \log_2 8 = 3 , \text{bits} ).

Limitations: Assumes uniform distributions, less effective for complex functions or non-uniform results.

3. Iterative Entropy Reconstruction
This method reconstructs entropy reduction per iteration based on result patterns, estimating information gain without initial entropy.

Utility: Useful when partial function information (e.g., statements, variables, result groupings) is known, as in game show scenarios like Jeopardy or Family Feud, where players decide when to interrupt based on predictive vs. observational efficiency (Jeopardy). The user emphasizes its role in determining whether predictive calculations or more observations are more efficient.

Entropy Calculation: Assume each result ( r_i ) from ( M ) outcomes reduces possibilities by a factor, estimating:
[ I_i \approx \log_2 M ]
Sum reductions:
[ H_{\text{computation}} \approx \sum_{i=1}^k I_i ]

Application: In Jeopardy, clues reduce the answer space. For ( k = 3 ) clues with ( M = 2 ), estimate ( H_0 \approx 3 \times 1 = 3 , \text{bits} ). If clues suggest a specific category, predictive calculations (e.g., guessing based on patterns) may outweigh waiting for more clues.

Limitations: Requires assumptions about query structure and result impact.

4. Sequence-Based Entropy
This approach computes the empirical entropy of the result sequence, assessing predictability without function knowledge.

Utility: Ideal when the generating function or partitioning is unknown, as the user notes for evaluating whether more results increase certainty (Family Feud). It answers, “Do results follow a predictable pattern?”

Entropy Calculation: For results ( R = { r_1, \ldots, r_k } ), compute:
[ H(R) = -\sum_r P(r) \log_2 P(r) ]
where ( P(r) ) is the frequency of outcome ( r ).

Application: In Family Feud, answers like {“car,” “house”} suggest patterns. If ( H(R) ) is low, more results may not add certainty, favoring alternative strategies.

Limitations: Limited to sequence statistics, not capturing computational structure.

5. Model Selection with Information Criteria
Model selection uses criteria like Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to choose among candidate functions, leveraging partial computational knowledge (Akaike Information Criterion).

Utility: Most effective with some function knowledge (e.g., result nature, outcome limits), as the user compares to algebraic reasoning. It estimates entropy without exact results, using their form and constraints.

Entropy Calculation: Compute AIC:
[ \text{AIC} = 2p - 2 \ln P(R | f_i) ]
where ( p ) is parameters in ( f_i ). Function probabilities:
[ P(f_i | R) \propto \exp(-\text{AIC}_i / 2) ]
Entropy:
[ H(F | R) = -\sum_i P(f_i | R) \log_2 P(f_i | R) ]

Application: In Hangman, knowing letter frequencies constrains functions. For ( k = 3 ) results, estimate ( H_0 ) based on outcome limits, selecting functions via AIC.

Limitations: Requires parameterized models, speculative without detailed knowledge.

Game Show Strategy: Optimal Interruption
In game shows like Jeopardy, Family Feud, or Hangman, players decide when to interrupt with an answer, balancing predictive calculations against observational gains. Iterative entropy reconstruction (Method 3) is particularly relevant, assessing whether predicting unknowns (e.g., guessing the answer) is more efficient than waiting for more clues. For example:

Jeopardy: Clues reduce answer possibilities. If ( M = 2 ), each clue provides ~1 bit. After 3 clues, ( H_3 \approx \log_2 8 = 3 , \text{bits} ). Predictive models (e.g., category knowledge) may suggest interrupting if ( H(F | R) ) is low.
Family Feud: Answers constrain popular responses. Sequence-based entropy (Method 4) evaluates if more answers increase certainty or if patterns suggest a guess.
Hangman: Letters narrow words. Model selection (Method 5) uses word length and letter frequencies to estimate when guessing outperforms waiting.

Optimal interruption occurs when the expected information gain from the next clue is less than the predictive model’s certainty, modeled as:
[ E[I_{k+1}] < H(F | R_k) ]
where ( E[I_{k+1}] \approx \log_2 M ).
Entropy of Function-to-Function Transformations
For functions taking and returning functions, entropy is often a relative delta, as the user predicts. Consider a higher-order function ( F: (X \to Y) \to (Z \to W) ). The entropy delta is:
[ \Delta H = H(\text{output function}) - H(\text{input function}) ]
This requires measuring the input and output functions’ entropies, often via their complexity (e.g., AST size in Lambda Calculus) or information content. For example, a compiler transforming a function ( f ) to ( g ) imparts an entropy delta based on ( g )’s complexity relative to ( f ). Methods like model selection estimate maximum/minimum entropy by constraining the function space:
[ H_{\text{max}} \approx \log_2 |\text{function space}| ]
[ H_{\text{min}} \approx \log_2 |\text{consistent functions}| ]
Combining methods (e.g., Bayesian inference for function probabilities, maximum entropy for input assumptions) provides a probabilistic range, seldom yielding a single number without a specific scenario.
Comprehensive Analysis
Weighing Problem Context
For 12 coins (24 scenarios), initial entropy is ( \log_2 24 \approx 4.585 , \text{bits} ), resolved in 3 weighings (( \log_2 3 \approx 1.585 , \text{bits} )). Without ( H_0 ), results like {balanced, left heavier, balanced} suggest ( N \leq 3^3 = 27 ), with Method 5 estimating ( H_0 \approx 4.755 , \text{bits} ).
Game 63
With 63 outcomes, ( H_0 = \log_2 63 \approx 5.977 , \text{bits} ), 6 binary queries (( I = 1 , \text{bit} )). Method 2 estimates ( H_0 \approx 6 , \text{bits} ) for simple functions, confirming uniform distribution.
Submarine
For a 10x10 grid (100 cells), ( H_0 = \log_2 100 \approx 6.644 , \text{bits} ), 7 binary queries. Method 4 assesses result patterns to evaluate observational efficiency.
Method Synergies
Combining methods enhances robustness:

Bayesian + Model Selection: Refines function probabilities with structural constraints.
Maximum Entropy + Sequence-Based: Balances uniform assumptions with empirical patterns.
Iterative Reconstruction: Guides strategic decisions in dynamic contexts.

Challenges

Unknowns: Missing ( H_0 ), input distributions, and function space require assumptions.
Non-Uniformity: Real-world results may not follow ideal splits.
Function Complexity: Higher-order functions complicate entropy measurement.

Conclusion
Computational entropy estimation mirrors thermodynamic entropy, with methods tailored to available information and desired outcomes. Bayesian inference suits finite function sets, maximum entropy simple functions, iterative reconstruction strategic decisions, sequence-based entropy pattern analysis, and model selection algebraic inference. For function-to-function transformations, relative entropy deltas are key, with probabilistic ranges derived from result information content. These methods, modeled in Lambda Calculus, provide a robust framework for understanding computational processes, particularly in dynamic, information-constrained scenarios like game shows.

Computation Entropy and the Weighing Problem
Key Points

Research suggests that the Weighing Problem, often associated with Claude Shannon’s information theory, involves identifying a defective item among a set using a balance scale, with each weighing reducing uncertainty.
It seems likely that iterative weighings in this problem decrease the entropy of the system by providing information, aligning with Shannon Entropy’s measure of uncertainty reduction.
The evidence leans toward modeling each weighing as an iterative computation that narrows possibilities, with entropy calculated as the logarithm of remaining scenarios, though the user’s phrasing of “producing entropy” may reflect a focus on the information generated per step.

Understanding the Weighing Problem
The Weighing Problem, commonly linked to Claude Shannon’s work in information theory, typically involves finding a single defective item (e.g., a coin that is heavier or lighter) among a set of identical items using a balance scale. Each weighing compares groups of items and has three possible outcomes: the left side is heavier, the right side is heavier, or the sides balance. These outcomes provide information that reduces uncertainty about which item is defective and whether it’s heavier or lighter.
Entropy in Iterative Computations
In this problem, you start with uncertainty about which item is defective. For example, with 12 coins, there are 24 possible scenarios (12 coins, each potentially heavier or lighter). Each weighing splits these possibilities into smaller groups, making the answer clearer step by step. In information theory, entropy measures this uncertainty, and each weighing reduces it by giving you new information, like narrowing down suspects in a game of clue. The user’s mention of “producing entropy” likely refers to the information each weighing generates, which reduces the overall uncertainty, though the term might be a misstatement for “reducing entropy.”
Relating to Shannon Entropy
Shannon Entropy measures how unpredictable something is. At the start, with 24 possible defective coins, the entropy is high because you’re very unsure. Each weighing provides up to about 1.58 bits of information (since there are three outcomes), cutting down the number of possibilities. After three well-planned weighings, you can pinpoint the defective coin and its nature, reducing the entropy to zero, meaning you’re certain of the answer.
Example with 12 Coins
Imagine you have 12 coins, and one is defective. Initially, you’re unsure which coin it is or if it’s heavier or lighter, so there are 24 possibilities, giving an entropy of about 4.58 bits. In a smart strategy, you might weigh four coins against four others:

If they balance, the defective coin is among the four not weighed, reducing possibilities to 8 (entropy drops to 3 bits).
If one side is heavier, it could be a heavy coin on that side or a light coin on the other, also giving 8 possibilities.You repeat this process, each weighing cutting down possibilities further, until after three weighings, you identify the defective coin, and the entropy becomes zero.

Computational Entropy in the Weighing Problem with Lambda Calculus
This exploration delves into applying the Weighing Problem, often associated with Claude Shannon’s contributions to information theory, as an example of iterative computations that reduce entropy through information gain, using Lambda Calculus to model the process. The Weighing Problem typically involves identifying a single defective item (e.g., a coin that is heavier or lighter) among a set of identical items using a balance scale, with each weighing providing information to narrow down possibilities. The user’s request to consider this problem in the context of “iterative computations producing entropy” is interpreted as examining how each weighing reduces system entropy by generating information, aligning with Shannon Entropy’s measure of uncertainty. We model the computation in Lambda Calculus to formalize the iterative process and calculate entropy, addressing the user’s prior discussions on infinite reduction paths and underivability without invoking the Constant Entropy model’s conservation principle. Aimed at readers with backgrounds in information theory, computational theory, and thermodynamics, this response provides a rigorous yet accessible analysis, integrating detailed calculations, Lambda Calculus constructions, and comparisons to Shannon Entropy, formatted in KaTeX-compatible LaTeX for Markdown rendering in VS Code’s Markdown+Math extension.
Background and Context
Shannon’s work in information theory revolutionized our understanding of uncertainty and information (Entropy (information theory)). The Weighing Problem, while not explicitly authored by Shannon in the provided search results, is a classic information theory puzzle often linked to his ideas, particularly in analyzing decision processes that reduce uncertainty (Balance puzzle). In its standard form, the problem involves ( n ) items (e.g., coins), one of which is defective (heavier or lighter), and the goal is to identify the defective item and its nature using a balance scale in the minimum number of weighings. Each weighing compares two groups of items, yielding three outcomes: left side heavier, right side heavier, or balanced, providing up to ( \log_2 3 \approx 1.585 ) bits of information.
The user’s phrase “iterative computations producing entropy” likely refers to the information generated by each weighing, which reduces the system’s entropy by resolving uncertainty, though “producing entropy” may be a misstatement for “reducing entropy” through information gain. In information theory, entropy quantifies uncertainty, and iterative computations (weighings) decrease entropy by partitioning the possibility space. Lambda Calculus, a Turing-complete system for functional computation (Lambda calculus), can model these weighings as term reductions, with entropy calculated as the uncertainty of the system state at each step. The user’s prior discussions on infinite reduction paths suggest an interest in computations where certain variables remain underivable, but here, we focus on finite reductions for the Weighing Problem, relating directly to Shannon Entropy.
The Weighing Problem
The classic Weighing Problem, as described in the balance puzzle (Balance puzzle), involves 12 coins, one of which is defective (heavier or lighter), and requires identifying the defective coin and its nature in at most three weighings. There are ( 12 \times 2 = 24 ) possible scenarios (12 coins, each potentially heavier or lighter). The balance scale’s three outcomes per weighing yield ( 3^3 = 27 ) possible outcome sequences, sufficient to distinguish 24 scenarios.
Each weighing is an iterative computation that partitions the set of possible scenarios, reducing uncertainty. Shannon Entropy, defined as:
[ H(X) = -\sum_{i} P(x_i) \log_2 P(x_i) ]
quantifies this uncertainty, where ( X ) is the random variable representing the defective coin and its nature, and ( P(x_i) ) is the probability of each scenario. Assuming equal likelihood, the initial entropy is:
[ H(X) = \log_2 24 \approx 4.585 , \text{bits} ]
Each weighing provides up to ( \log_2 3 \approx 1.585 ) bits, and an optimal strategy ensures the entropy reaches zero after three weighings, identifying the defective coin.
Modeling with Lambda Calculus
To formalize the iterative computations, we model the Weighing Problem in Lambda Calculus, representing each weighing as a function application that reduces the set of possibilities. A lambda term encodes the computation, with reductions simulating weighings and entropy calculated as the uncertainty of the remaining scenarios.

Representation:

State: The set of possible scenarios is a list of pairs (coin, defect type), e.g., (\text{cons} , (1, \text{heavy}) , (\text{cons} , (1, \text{light}) , \ldots , \text{nil})) for 24 pairs.
Weighing: A function (\lambda \text{state}.\lambda \text{weighing}.\text{filter}(\text{state}, \text{weighing})) that filters scenarios based on the weighing’s outcome (left heavier, right heavier, balanced).
Reduction: Applying the weighing function reduces the state to a new list, e.g., from 24 to 8 scenarios after the first weighing.

Entropy Calculation:

At each step, the entropy is the logarithm of the number of remaining scenarios, assuming equal probabilities for simplicity:
[ H(\text{state}_i) = \log_2 |\text{state}_i| ]
where (|\text{state}_i|) is the number of scenarios after ( i ) weighings.

For 12 coins:

Initial: (|\text{state}_0| = 24), (H(\text{state}_0) = \log_2 24 \approx 4.585 , \text{bits}).
After first weighing (e.g., 8 scenarios): (H(\text{state}_1) = \log_2 8 = 3 , \text{bits}).
After second weighing (e.g., 3 scenarios): (H(\text{state}_2) = \log_2 3 \approx 1.585 , \text{bits}).
After third weighing (1 scenario): (H(\text{state}_3) = \log_2 1 = 0 , \text{bits}).

Infinite Reduction Paths: While the user’s prior discussions emphasized infinite reduction paths for underivability, the Weighing Problem involves finite reductions, as each weighing converges to a solution. However, we can model underivability by ensuring that attempting to retrieve hidden variables (e.g., the defective coin’s identity without weighings) triggers divergence, preserving their entropy.

Example: Weighing Strategy for 12 Coins
Consider a standard strategy:

First Weighing: Divide 12 coins into three groups of 4 (A: 1-4, B: 5-8, C: 9-12). Weigh A vs. B.
Balanced: Defective in C (8 scenarios: 9-12, heavier or lighter).
A heavier: Either A has a heavy coin or B has a light coin (8 scenarios).
B heavier: Similar (8 scenarios).
Entropy: (H(\text{state}_1) = \log_2 8 = 3 , \text{bits}).

Second Weighing: For balanced case, weigh C1, C2 vs. C3, C4.
Balanced: Entropy reduces to (\log_2 3 \approx 1.585 , \text{bits}) (3 scenarios).
C1, C2 heavier: Similar reduction.

Third Weighing: Resolves to 1 scenario, (H(\text{state}_3) = 0).

Lambda Calculus Model
Define a term (M = \lambda \text{state}.\lambda \text{weighing}.\text{filter}(\text{state}, \text{weighing})):

Initial State: (\text{state}_0 = \text{list of 24 pairs}).
Weighing: (\text{weighing}_1 = \lambda s.\text{partition}(s, [1-4], [5-8])), reducing to (\text{state}_1) with 8 pairs.
Entropy: (H(\text{state}_0) = \log_2 24), (H(\text{state}_1) = \log_2 8).

Reversing without weighings, e.g., (M' = \lambda o.\lambda x.\Omega), diverges, preserving input entropy.
Relating to Shannon Entropy
Shannon Entropy quantifies uncertainty:
[ H(X) = -\sum_{i} P(x_i) \log_2 P(x_i) ]
Each weighing reduces (H(X)) by providing information (I(X; Y_i)). The model’s iterative reductions mirror this, with entropy decreasing as possibilities are eliminated, directly relating to Shannon’s framework.
Challenges and Considerations

Misinterpretation of “Producing Entropy”: Likely means producing information that reduces entropy.
Non-Termination: Infinite paths are not needed here but can model underivability.
Probability Assumptions: Equal probabilities simplify calculations but may not reflect optimal strategies.
Rendering: KaTeX ensures compatibility.

Conclusion
The Weighing Problem illustrates iterative computations reducing entropy through information gain, modeled in Lambda Calculus as term reductions, with entropy calculated as the logarithm of remaining possibilities, directly relating to Shannon Entropy.

Shannon Entropy in Games 63 and Submarine: Iterative Uncertainty Reduction
Introduction
Shannon Entropy, a cornerstone of information theory introduced by Claude Shannon in his seminal 1948 paper, quantifies the uncertainty or information content of a random variable, measured in bits as ( H(X) = -\sum_i P(x_i) \log_2 P(x_i) ), where ( P(x_i) ) is the probability of outcome ( x_i ) (Entropy (information theory)). In games and decision-making processes, entropy measures the uncertainty about an unknown state, and iterative actions (e.g., queries or guesses) reduce this uncertainty by providing information. The user requests an expansion of the Weighing Problem analysis to include the Shannon Entropy examples of the games "63" and "Submarine," interpreted as scenarios where iterative computations reduce uncertainty, modeled in Lambda Calculus to align with prior discussions on computational entropy.
The games "63" and "Submarine" are not explicitly documented as standard Shannon Entropy examples in the provided sources, but they can be reasonably interpreted based on context. "63" likely refers to a guessing game with 63 possible outcomes, where iterative yes/no questions identify the correct outcome, similar to Twenty Questions or the Weighing Problem. "Submarine" resembles a search game, akin to Battleship, where a hidden object (e.g., a submarine) is located in a grid through queries that narrow down possible locations (Battleship (game)). This document models these games in Lambda Calculus, calculates their Shannon Entropy at each iterative step, and relates the process to information gain, providing a rigorous analysis for readers with backgrounds in information theory, computational theory, and thermodynamics, formatted in KaTeX-compatible LaTeX for Markdown rendering in VS Code’s Markdown+Math extension.
Modeling Games with Lambda Calculus
Game 63: Guessing Among 63 Possibilities
The "63" game is interpreted as a guessing game where one item must be identified among 63 equally likely possibilities (e.g., a number from 1 to 63). The initial entropy, assuming uniform probability, is:
[ H(X) = \log_2 63 \approx 5.977 , \text{bits} ]
Each yes/no question ideally halves the possibilities, providing 1 bit of information and reducing entropy by approximately 1 bit. After ( k ) questions, the number of remaining possibilities is ( \lceil 63 / 2^k \rceil ), and entropy is:
[ H_k = \log_2 \lceil 63 / 2^k \rceil ]
After 6 questions, ( \lceil 63 / 2^6 \rceil = \lceil 63 / 64 \rceil = 1 ), reducing entropy to ( \log_2 1 = 0 ), identifying the item.
In Lambda Calculus, model the state as a list of 63 possibilities, with each question as a function application that filters the list. Define:
[ M = \lambda \text{state}.\lambda \text{query}.\text{filter}(\text{state}, \text{query}) ]

Initial State: (\text{state}_0 = \text{list of } {1, 2, \ldots, 63}).
Query: (\text{query}_1 = \lambda s.\text{partition}(s, s \leq 31)), splitting into ( {1, \ldots, 31} ) (31 items) or ( {32, \ldots, 63} ) (32 items).
Entropy: ( H(\text{state}_0) = \log_2 63 \approx 5.977 ), ( H(\text{state}_1) = \log_2 32 = 5 ) or ( \log_2 31 \approx 4.954 ).

Each reduction step filters the state, reducing entropy until a single item remains.
Submarine: Search in a Grid
The "Submarine" game is interpreted as a search game similar to Battleship, where a submarine is hidden in one cell of a 10x10 grid (100 cells). Initial entropy is:
[ H(X) = \log_2 100 \approx 6.644 , \text{bits} ]
Queries divide the grid, e.g., asking if the submarine is in the left half (50 cells). Each yes/no query provides up to 1 bit, reducing entropy to:
[ H_k = \log_2 \lceil 100 / 2^k \rceil ]
After 7 queries, ( \lceil 100 / 2^7 \rceil = 1 ), entropy is 0. In Lambda Calculus:
[ M = \lambda \text{state}.\lambda \text{query}.\text{filter}(\text{state}, \text{query}) ]

Initial State: (\text{state}_0 = \text{list of } {(1,1), \ldots, (10,10)}).
Query: (\text{query}_1 = \lambda s.\text{partition}(s, \text{column} \leq 5)), splitting into left (50 cells) or right half.
Entropy: ( H(\text{state}_0) = \log_2 100 \approx 6.644 ), ( H(\text{state}_1) = \log_2 50 \approx 5.644 ).

Information Gain
Each query’s information gain is:
[ I = H_{\text{before}} - H_{\text{after}} ]
For "63," a query reducing from 63 to 32 possibilities yields ( I \approx \log_2 63 - \log_2 32 \approx 0.977 ) bits. For "Submarine," from 100 to 50, ( I \approx 1 ) bit. Optimal strategies maximize ( I ), minimizing steps to zero entropy.
Computational Entropy and Shannon Entropy
In both games, iterative computations (queries) reduce entropy by partitioning the state space, directly relating to Shannon Entropy’s measure of uncertainty reduction. Lambda Calculus models these as function applications, with entropy calculated as the logarithm of remaining possibilities or via probability distributions over reduction paths, providing a formal computational framework.

Shannon Entropy in Games 63 and Submarine: A Comprehensive Analysis
Introduction
Shannon Entropy, introduced by Claude Shannon in his 1948 paper "A Mathematical Theory of Communication," quantifies the uncertainty or information content of a random variable, defined as ( H(X) = -\sum_i P(x_i) \log_2 P(x_i) ), where ( P(x_i) ) is the probability of outcome ( x_i ) (Entropy (information theory)). In games and decision-making scenarios, entropy measures the uncertainty about an unknown state, and iterative actions, such as queries or guesses, reduce this uncertainty by providing information. The Weighing Problem, a classic example, involves identifying a defective item among a set using a balance scale, with each weighing reducing entropy through information gain (Balance puzzle). The user requests an expansion of this analysis to include the Shannon Entropy examples of the games "63" and "Submarine," interpreted as scenarios where iterative computations reduce uncertainty, modeled in Lambda Calculus to align with prior discussions on computational entropy.
The games "63" and "Submarine" are not explicitly documented as standard Shannon Entropy examples in the provided sources, but they can be reasonably interpreted based on context. "63" is likely a guessing game with 63 possible outcomes, where iterative yes/no questions identify the correct outcome, similar to Twenty Questions or the Weighing Problem. "Submarine" resembles a search game, akin to Battleship, where a hidden object (e.g., a submarine) is located in a grid through queries that narrow down possible locations (Battleship (game)).

Shannon Entropy in Games
Shannon Entropy measures the average uncertainty in a random variable’s outcomes. For a discrete set of ( n ) equally likely outcomes, entropy is:
[ H(X) = \log_2 n ]
In games, each iterative action (e.g., a question or query) partitions the outcome space, reducing entropy by the information gained, defined as:
[ I = H_{\text{before}} - H_{\text{after}} ]
where ( H_{\text{after}} = \sum_i P_i \log_2 |S_i| ), with ( P_i ) as the probability of outcome ( i ) and ( |S_i| ) as the size of the resulting subset. Optimal strategies maximize ( I ), minimizing the steps to reach zero entropy (certainty).
Game 63: Guessing Among 63 Possibilities
The "63" game is interpreted as a guessing game where one item must be identified among 63 equally likely possibilities (e.g., a number from 1 to 63). The initial entropy is:
[ H(X) = \log_2 63 \approx 5.977 , \text{bits} ]
Each yes/no question ideally halves the possibilities, providing approximately 1 bit of information. After ( k ) questions, the number of remaining possibilities is ( \lceil 63 / 2^k \rceil ), and entropy is:
[ H_k = \log_2 \lceil 63 / 2^k \rceil ]
For example:

After 1 question (e.g., “Is it ≤ 31?”), possibilities reduce to 31 or 32: ( H_1 \approx \log_2 32 = 5 ) or ( \log_2 31 \approx 4.954 , \text{bits} ).
After 6 questions, ( \lceil 63 / 2^6 \rceil = 1 ), so ( H_6 = 0 ).

The information gained per question is:
[ I = H_{k-1} - H_k ]
For the first question, ( I \approx 5.977 - 5 \approx 0.977 , \text{bits} ) (if 32 possibilities remain).
In Lambda Calculus, model the state as a list of 63 possibilities, with each question as a function application:
[ M = \lambda \text{state}.\lambda \text{query}.\text{filter}(\text{state}, \text{query}) ]

Initial State: (\text{state}_0 = \text{list of } {1, 2, \ldots, 63}).
Query: (\text{query}_1 = \lambda s.\text{partition}(s, s \leq 31)), yielding (\text{state}_1) with 31 or 32 items.
Entropy: ( H(\text{state}_0) = \log_2 63 \approx 5.977 ), ( H(\text{state}_1) \approx 5 ).

Each reduction filters the state, reducing entropy until one item remains. If reversing to retrieve the input without queries triggers an infinite reduction path (e.g., via (\lambda x.\Omega)), the input’s entropy is preserved, as in prior discussions.
Submarine: Search in a Grid
The "Submarine" game is interpreted as a search game similar to Battleship, where a submarine is hidden in one cell of a 10x10 grid (100 cells). Initial entropy is:
[ H(X) = \log_2 100 \approx 6.644 , \text{bits} ]
Each yes/no query divides the grid, e.g., “Is it in the left half (columns 1–5)?” reduces possibilities to 50 cells:
[ H_1 = \log_2 50 \approx 5.644 , \text{bits} ]
Information gained:
[ I = 6.644 - 5.644 = 1 , \text{bit} ]
After 7 queries, ( \lceil 100 / 2^7 \rceil = 1 ), so ( H_7 = 0 ). An optimal strategy might use queries that split possibilities unevenly but maximize expected information gain, akin to the Weighing Problem’s three-outcome queries.
In Lambda Calculus:
[ M = \lambda \text{state}.\lambda \text{query}.\text{filter}(\text{state}, \text{query}) ]

Initial State: (\text{state}_0 = \text{list of } {(1,1), \ldots, (10,10)}).
Query: (\text{query}_1 = \lambda s.\text{partition}(s, \text{column} \leq 5)), yielding (\text{state}_1) with 50 cells.
Entropy: ( H(\text{state}_0) = \log_2 100 \approx 6.644 ), ( H(\text{state}_1) \approx 5.644 ).

Reversing without queries could trigger divergence, preserving the submarine’s location entropy.
Comparison with Weighing Problem
The Weighing Problem with 12 coins (24 scenarios) has initial entropy ( \log_2 24 \approx 4.585 , \text{bits} ). Each three-outcome weighing provides up to ( \log_2 3 \approx 1.585 , \text{bits} ), reducing entropy to zero in three steps. Similarly, "63" and "Submarine" involve iterative queries reducing entropy, but "63" uses binary queries (1 bit each), and "Submarine" may use binary or multi-outcome queries, depending on the strategy.

Relating to Shannon Entropy
Shannon Entropy quantifies uncertainty reduction in these games. Each query partitions the outcome space, with the expected entropy after a query given by:
[ H_{\text{after}} = \sum_i P_i \log_2 |S_i| ]
Information gain is the reduction in entropy, directly relating to Shannon’s framework. Lambda Calculus models these partitions as function applications, with entropy calculated as ( \log_2 |S_i| ) or via probability distributions over reduction paths, providing a computational perspective on information gain.
Challenges and Considerations

Game Identification: The lack of direct references to "63" and "Submarine" as standard Shannon Entropy examples requires interpretive assumptions, potentially misaligning with the user’s intent.
Query Optimization: Optimal strategies maximize information gain, which may involve non-binary queries in "Submarine," complicating entropy calculations.
Lambda Calculus Modeling: Finite reductions suffice for these games, but infinite paths could model underivability of initial states, as in prior discussions.
Probability Assumptions: Uniform probabilities simplify calculations but may not reflect real-world strategies.

Conclusion
The games "63" and "Submarine" illustrate Shannon Entropy’s application to iterative uncertainty reduction, modeled in Lambda Calculus as state-filtering reductions. "63" involves identifying one of 63 outcomes through yes/no questions, reducing entropy from 5.977 bits to zero in about 6 steps. "Submarine," akin to Battleship, locates a hidden object in a 10x10 grid, reducing entropy from 6.644 bits to zero in about 7 steps. These examples highlight how each computational step provides information, aligning with Shannon Entropy’s measure of uncertainty reduction, offering insights into decision-making and search strategies.
