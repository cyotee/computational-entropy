# Comparative Costs of Blackjack Strategies

## Key Points

- Research suggests that a combined cost model, integrating the number of classes and average SUCC operations per draw, can comprehensively quantify the computational and cognitive effort of blackjack card counting strategies.
- It seems likely that Hi-Lo will maintain a high value due to its moderate cost in both classes and SUCC operations, while Hi-Opt II may be less efficient due to its higher class cost, despite similar SUCC costs.
- The evidence leans toward defining a new efficiency metric that normalizes entropy reduction by a weighted combination of classes and SUCC costs, allowing direct comparison of strategies.
- There’s uncertainty about the optimal weighting of classes versus SUCC costs, but a balanced approach can provide meaningful insights.

### Comprehensive Cost Model

The original cost model used the number of classes (\( C_s \)) to represent the complexity of the counting system:

- **Basic Strategy**: 1 class (no counting).
- **Hi-Lo**: 3 classes (-1, 0, +1).
- **Hi-Opt II**: 5 classes (-2, -1, 0, +1, +2).

The SUCC-based cost model, introduced previously, measures the average number of successor operations (SUCCs) per draw to update the state (\( N \) for deck size, RC for running count):

- **Basic Strategy**: 1 SUCC (decrement \( N \)).
- **Hi-Lo**: 1.7692 SUCCs (1 for \( N \), plus 0 or 1 for RC, weighted by card probabilities).
- **Hi-Opt II**: 1.7689 SUCCs (1 for \( N \), plus 1 or 2 for RC, weighted by card probabilities).

The new cost model combines these:

- **Classes (\( C_s \))**: Reflects the structural complexity or cognitive effort of maintaining distinct count categories.
- **Average SUCCs (\( S_s \))**: Reflects the computational effort of updating the state per draw, averaged over the card value distribution.

To integrate both, we define a **combined cost** as a weighted sum:
\[
\text{Combined Cost}_s = \alpha \cdot C_s + (1 - \alpha) \cdot S_s
\]
where \(\alpha \in [0, 1]\) is a weighting factor balancing the importance of classes and SUCCs. For simplicity, we assume \(\alpha = 0.5\) to give equal weight to both costs, but this can be adjusted based on context (e.g., prioritizing cognitive effort with higher \(\alpha\)).

### Calculating Combined Costs

- **Basic Strategy**:
  - Classes: \( C_{\text{basic}} = 1 \).
  - Average SUCCs: \( S_{\text{basic}} = 1 \).
  - Combined Cost: \( 0.5 \cdot 1 + 0.5 \cdot 1 = 1 \).
- **Hi-Lo**:
  - Classes: \( C_{\text{HiLo}} = 3 \).
  - Average SUCCs: \( S_{\text{HiLo}} = 1.7692 \).
  - Combined Cost: \( 0.5 \cdot 3 + 0.5 \cdot 1.7692 = 1.5 + 0.8846 = 2.3846 \).
- **Hi-Opt II**:
  - Classes: \( C_{\text{HiOpt}} = 5 \).
  - Average SUCCs: \( S_{\text{HiOpt}} = 1.7689 \).
  - Combined Cost: \( 0.5 \cdot 5 + 0.5 \cdot 1.7689 = 2.5 + 0.8845 = 3.3845 \).

### Efficiency Metric with Combined Cost

We extend the efficiency metric from the previous analyses to use the combined cost:
\[
\text{Efficiency}_s = \frac{51 - k_s}{\text{Combined Cost}_s}
\]
where:

- \( k_s \): The draw at which entropy \( H_s(k) \leq 1 \) bit, indicating high certainty.
- \( 51 - k_s \): The number of draws “saved” by reaching high certainty before the final draw (51, when \( N = 1 \)).
- \(\text{Combined Cost}_s = \alpha \cdot C_s + (1 - \alpha) \cdot S_s\): The weighted cost combining classes and SUCC operations.

Using the previous estimates for \( k_s \):

- **Basic Strategy**: \( k_{\text{basic}} = 51 \) (reaches certainty only at the last draw).
- **Hi-Lo**: \( k_{\text{HiLo}} \approx 40 \) (reaches \( H \leq 1 \) around draw 40).
- **Hi-Opt II**: \( k_{\text{HiOpt}} \approx 38 \) (reaches \( H \leq 1 \) around draw 38).

### Calculating Efficiency

- **Basic Strategy**:
  - Combined Cost: 1.
  - Draws Saved: \( 51 - 51 = 0 \).
  - Efficiency: \(\frac{0}{1} = 0\).
- **Hi-Lo**:
  - Combined Cost: 2.3846.
  - Draws Saved: \( 51 - 40 = 11 \).
  - Efficiency: \(\frac{11}{2.3846} \approx 4.61\).
- **Hi-Opt II**:
  - Combined Cost: 3.3845.
  - Draws Saved: \( 51 - 38 = 13 \).
  - Efficiency: \(\frac{13}{3.3845} \approx 3.84\).

### Alternative Value Metric: Cumulative Entropy Reduction

To capture the continuous improvement in predictive capacity, we can use the cumulative entropy reduction normalized by the combined cost:
\[
I_s = \sum_{k=0}^{51} \left( H_s(0) - H_s(k) \right)
\]
\[
\text{Value}_s = \frac{I_s}{\text{Combined Cost}_s}
\]
where \( I_s \) is the total information gained (approximated as the area under the entropy reduction curve from previous simulations).

From prior simulations (approximate values for illustration):

- **Basic Strategy**: \( I_{\text{basic}} \approx 0 \) (minimal reduction until draw 51).
- **Hi-Lo**: \( I_{\text{HiLo}} \approx 50 \) (arbitrary units, based on entropy curve).
- **Hi-Opt II**: \( I_{\text{HiOpt}} \approx 52 \) (slightly faster reduction).

Calculating value:

- **Basic Strategy**: \(\frac{0}{1} = 0\).
- **Hi-Lo**: \(\frac{50}{2.3846} \approx 20.97\).
- **Hi-Opt II**: \(\frac{52}{3.3845} \approx 15.36\).

### Analysis of Results

  - **Cost**: Lowest combined cost (1), as it requires only 1 class and 1 SUCC per draw.
  - **Predictive Capacity**: No entropy reduction until draw 51, resulting in zero efficiency and value.
  - **Implication**: Offers minimal effort but no predictive benefit, suitable only for players avoiding counting.
- **Hi-Lo**:
  - **Cost**: Moderate combined cost (2.3846), reflecting 3 classes and an average of 1.7692 SUCCs per draw.
  - **Predictive Capacity**: Reaches high certainty at draw 40, saving 11 draws, with strong entropy reduction (\( I_{\text{HiLo}} \approx 50 \)).
  - **Efficiency**: High (4.61), as it achieves significant predictive gains with moderate cost.
  - **Value**: Highest (20.97), indicating excellent information gain per unit cost.
  - **Implication**: Balances accuracy and effort, making it the optimal choice for most players.
- **Hi-Opt II**:
  - **Cost**: Highest combined cost (3.3845), due to 5 classes and an average of 1.7689 SUCCs per draw.
  - **Predictive Capacity**: Reaches high certainty earliest (draw 38), saving 13 draws, with slightly higher entropy reduction (\( I_{\text{HiOpt}} \approx 52 \)).
  - **Efficiency**: Moderate (3.84), as the higher cost offsets the earlier certainty.
  - **Value**: Lower than Hi-Lo (15.36), due to the increased cost outweighing marginal predictive gains.
  - **Implication**: Offers the fastest certainty but at a higher effort, suitable for advanced players.

### Comparing Cost Models

- **Classes Only (Previous Model)**:
  - Costs: 1, 3, 5.
  - Efficiencies: 0, 3.67, 2.6.
  - Hi-Lo was the most efficient, as its moderate cost (3) balanced well with predictive gains.
- **SUCCs Only (Previous Extension)**:
  - Costs: 1, 1.7692, 1.7689.
  - Efficiencies: 0, 6.22, 7.35.
  - Hi-Opt II was the most efficient, as its SUCC cost was close to Hi-Lo’s, amplifying its earlier certainty.
- **Combined Cost (Current Model)**:
  - Costs: 1, 2.3846, 3.3845.
  - Efficiencies: 0, 4.61, 3.84.
  - Values: 0, 20.97, 15.36.
  - Hi-Lo regains the lead, as the combined cost penalizes Hi-Opt II’s higher class complexity while acknowledging its slightly faster entropy reduction.

The combined cost model provides a more nuanced view, capturing both the structural complexity (classes) and dynamic effort (SUCCs) of each strategy.

### Example Simulation with Combined Cost

| **Strategy** | **Classes (\( C_s \))** | **Avg SUCCs (\( S_s \))** | **Combined Cost** | **Draws to \( H \leq 1 \)** | **Draws Saved** | **Efficiency** | **Cumulative Value** |
|--------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------|----------------------------|-----------------|----------------|----------------------|
| Basic        | 1                       | 1                        | 1                 | 51                         | 0               | 0              | 0                    |

| Hi-Opt II    | 5                       | 1.7689                   | 3.3845            | 38                         | 13              | 3.84           | 15.36                |

## Implications for Strategy Selection

- **Hi-Lo**: Offers the highest value in the combined cost model, with an efficiency of 4.61 and a cumulative value of 20.97. It achieves high certainty (draw 40) with a moderate combined cost (2.3846), balancing structural complexity (3 classes) and computational effort (1.7692 SUCCs). It’s the optimal choice for players seeking efficient predictive gains.
- **Hi-Opt II**: Provides strong predictive capacity, reaching high certainty earliest (draw 38), but its higher combined cost (3.3845) due to 5 classes results in lower efficiency (3.84) and value (15.36). It’s suitable for advanced players prioritizing accuracy over simplicity.
- **Basic Strategy**: Minimizes cost (combined cost = 1) but offers no predictive improvement, with zero efficiency and value. It’s only viable for players avoiding any counting effort.

## Challenges and Limitations

- **Weighting Factor (\(\alpha\))**: The choice of \(\alpha = 0.5\) balances classes and SUCCs equally. Different values (e.g., \(\alpha = 0.7\) for more emphasis on classes) could alter efficiency rankings, favoring Hi-Lo further if classes dominate.
- **Sequence Variability**: Entropy reduction and \( k_s \) depend on the draw sequence, with extreme counts accelerating convergence for counting strategies. Estimates assume a typical sequence.
- **SUCC Cost Simplification**: Counting SUCCs as the absolute value of count changes simplifies cognitive effort. Actual effort may vary, especially for Hi-Opt II’s larger count changes.
- **Practical Constraints**: In real blackjack, reshuffling prevents reaching 51 draws, but the analysis assumes no reshuffling to meet the user’s requirements.

## Conclusion

Expanding the blackjack card prediction analysis to include both the original cost in classes and the SUCC-based cost provides a comprehensive measure of each strategy’s computational and cognitive effort. The combined cost model, defined as \(\alpha \cdot C_s + (1 - \alpha) \cdot S_s\) with \(\alpha = 0.5\), yields costs of 1, 2.3846, and 3.3845 for basic strategy, Hi-Lo, and Hi-Opt II, respectively. The efficiency metric \(\frac{51 - k_s}{\text{Combined Cost}_s}\) shows Hi-Lo as the most valuable strategy (efficiency ≈ 4.61, value ≈ 20.97), followed by Hi-Opt II (3.84, 15.36) and basic strategy (0, 0). Hi-Lo’s moderate cost and strong predictive capacity make it the optimal choice for balancing accuracy and effort in single-player blackjack card prediction, confirming its robustness across cost models ([Card Counting]([invalid url, do not cite])).
